1:21 when someone steal yo oscar
"Watched it yesterday, fantastic tragicomedy. And Harrelson, Rockwell and MacDormand are simply amazing!"
Oh god what a movie ... üíôüëå
"You deserve it, Frances . What an amazing act!! You such a brilliant actorss"
This movie was soooo incredibly good. One of the best movies I've watched in a while. I'm so suprised it didn't win the Oscar. I was really shocked at the sudden end tho..
"It was good but the ending sucked. It wasn't a bad ending, just not a fulfilling one."
this looks stupid.
"This is a gem,trust me, PLEASE its one of THOSE movies,holy cow watch this"
Oh snap! I actually really got sold on this trailer. I initially had no intention of watching this.
Looking at Frances Mcdormands Oscar speech I don't think she really had to act in this movie
"Frances McDormand deserves the Oscar, she was amazing. Same as Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson."
What is the song starting at :20?
And well-earned Oscars to McDormand and Rockwell.
I was really impressed with this movie. Wonderful!
So she commits arson.  She commits aggregated assault
WTG Margie!
This is a long stretch from Miss Clevelle
"I've been trying to find it to watch... but serious congratulations to F. McDormand (best actress) and all our favorite guy. Sam Rockwell (best supporting male actor) for their Oscars! Sam, you are amazing."
So glad I didn't watch this trailer before watching the movie üëå
"Scenario je ocajan, tema i poenta nema ih, nista nije smesno jedino ako si debil onda ce ti mozda biti"
Glupo glupo glupo
"Stupid movie, for thoes people who say something stupid and then laugh on their own jokes"
best trailer ever! ¬†dying to see this you reallying bitch! lmao
Lady with a funny reallyin eye?
I don‚Äôt understand how Fox can produce a film like this and also produce Fox News.
I don‚Äôt understand how Fox can produce a film like this and also produce Fox News.
The Girl was really a Boy in Drag whom she kicked in the Nuts!
"Dang, she's a Bad-A"
"I love McDormand. She feels so real in every role she's in. Oddly, she's always likable, even in unlikable roles."
One of the best movies I have seen in a while along with 'Molly's Game '
"Disappointing movie, really. It could have been so much better except for the anti-white/anti-cop/anti-Christian agenda that infects the first half of the script. Once the London writer gets his predictable angry liberal rant out through his characters and actually attempts to depict rural America in an uncondescending manner (if that's possible for Hollywood). The second half starts to recover by softening Frances character and fleshing out Sam Rockwell's. Unfortunately, Frances' bitter, man hating character is way too one dimensional (the real woman Marianne Asher-Chapman, was much more nuanced, the Director should have depicted that) and frankly tiresome. 

Rockwell, however, despite his hammy role written for him by an anti gun Londoner urbanite, puts in a sterling performance. I haven't watched the driberal self congratulatory bash at the Dolby theater but I'm assuming this movie did very well, the racket-machine had earmarked it for an ""Oscar nod"" months before and I think most, like myself, had decided they liked Frances character just going by the trailer cuts. Big mistake."
"This is what inspired the film:
https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Many-billboards-outside-Vidor-Texas-inspired-12725893.php"
A dark redneck drama wtf
What a movie just finished right now
reallyin boring movie ..waste of time
"Weell now i see why she won the Oscar well deserve
That last part was everything 
Frances McDorman üëèüòäüèÜ"
Happy this didn't win a Oscar for best picture
This movie was reallying robbed at the oscars
After #oscars
really excited to watch this üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
She‚Äôs good
Martin McDonagh is a brilliant playwright and screenwriter. Plays like The Pillowman and the Leenage trilogy are significant contributions to the theatre. His transformation from great Irish playwright to screenwriter and director proves his innate gift.
who is watching this trailer after       Oscar award results???
This film is amazing. So glad Frances and Sam just won Oscars for it. Incredibly well-deserved.
"Best movie I've seen in about 10 years, definitely."
Why wasn't ¬†this movie german cinemas?
The Shape of Water robbed this movie.
"Although the movie has some qualities and it definitely had (unfulfilled) potential i think it is severely overrated and nowhere close to some Coen movies that were it's biggest influence.The cast was good but i found the characters non-relatable to downright unlikable and it's comical parts were very offbeat. Not a bad movie by any means, but no way a masterpiece either and worse than the sum of it's parts.I found most movies this year to be overrated, this one as well as Dunkirk, Phantom thread and Blade Runner 2049, although the last one was visually a sight to behold, it's art direction was one of the best in the history of cinema."
"Amazingly entertaining movie, instant classic. Surprisingly funny as really."
So good besides all of the violence and swearing
Frances and Sam are great in this but this is also one of Woody's best.
This is the saddest movie I have ever seen in 2018. Just sad üò¢! Made my mood off
Great movie :)
"to much violence in this damn movie, I don¬¥t like."
Congratulations #FrancesMcDormand!!!
No oscar
I CANT STRESS ENOUGH HOW AMAZING THIS MOVIE WAS.
Best actress!
Best actress winner üåà
and the Oscar for best actress goes to...
"I thought Woody would get that Oscar I'm a little bit disappointed ,but well done Sam anyway"
Congratulations Sam!
Here after Sam Rockwell won best supporting actor
Can someone tell me what the 1st song was
"How many movie producers could get away with cursing a meal during the Jewish holy day of Passover?  Or using profanity against the Muslim feast of Eid? Not one, you'll never see it. But Christianity? It's always open season in diabolical Hollywood against Christianity as evidenced in this filthy trailer. Thanks Hollywood. Nice. And during Lent even. You always manage to show who you are: Satanists, dead to life, greedy for money, filthy minded and typically anti-Christian!"
This is the kind of film that might have an effect on society!
"Poor Tyrion, he was so innocent in this movie, but what a fresh and great movie."
"the movie is about town in tx. It a true story about Vidor, TX"
This looks like its based on a true story in Missouri.  http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43259912/meet-the-real-life-three-billboards-mother
Did anyone here see Fargo?  Great movie.
Why does she not get arrested?
"It is the best movie. Don't be afraid to watch it. 
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri fuII movie [ nerdy.bid/7isGA ]"
great movie...gets the gold
Eh too much cussing
One of the best movies I've seen in YEARS! I am looking forward to seeing the Shape of water next but for now this was the BEST!!!!
Good movie
"I adore this movie it made me laugh, it made me cry it‚Äôs the best movie ever"
Just saw it yesterday! Such a good movie and she really deserves this oscar nomination!
This is beautiful
Just watched it. I liked it ok but I was a bit disspointed if I'm being completely honest.
Silly. Kind of wasting time.
where's the sequel?
"years ago I called my Ex really head, he bust out laughing, I swear I never even heard of the word it just came out lol"
"Amazing movie. Far from beautiful, but amazing. I already know I won't be able to get it out of my head for weeks"
The movie should‚Äôve been named ‚Äú state of the union‚Äù.it‚Äôs brilliant.
boy a lot of really bitch and ass
and 'Walk away Renee' by the mighty Four Tops...
Great great movie!
I'VE JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE..AND I SAW MOST OF THE NOMINATED ONES...THIS ONE DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE HANDS DOWN.
Disappointing ending
Loved this movie. 100% recommend
Am going now for sure
One of the best movies for me an instant classic.
"Who's here after Oscar nomination??
xD"
Future classic right here

"mcdormands character looks like shell make me pee LMAO, her acting is underrated by farrrrr. watching this movie."
One of my favorite movies of all time
Masterpiece.
I love her character that she is honest about her opinion and doesn't give a cow of what anyone thinks
one the most confused films i have ever seen. Was it a dark comedy? was it about a woman who was fighting for other women? wtf was this cow?
"""This doesn't put an end to cow you reallying retard.¬†

She deserves an oscar even Sam men he deserves too they reallying deserve oscar
Best movie üçø I‚Äôve seen in a long time!!
This movie was awesome if you can go watch it
These reallying spoiling trailers
It's meh. Expected more.

this is the best movie of all time
Just watched this film...I must say absolutely fantastic.
"One of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen! So intense, funny, sad. It has it all."
reallying feministic movie. I‚Äôd like to kill that bitch
It's absolutely brilliant
During the 10 year skip in true detective season 1
What's the song that starts at 1:33 thx
"This is ostensibly base on a father's quest for justice in Vidor, Texas. The father was James Fulton whose daughter Kathy Page was raped and strangled to death in 1991.

"This SHOULD win best picture... will it no. Reality does get applied to oscars. They live in fantasy land and don‚Äôt understand real life. It should win, but it will go too some fantasy film or a movie about queer black men"
"The worst movie ever. Any ""foulmouth"" could write a script like this .  Just another example of the U.S.A."
"See the movie's pretty good, Daughter being murdered.... Poor kid, But the messages sent on the billboard signs from the dead daughter are down right scary"
They can't even arrest someone who burn down the police station.. let alone to catch a rapist.
I love this movie
It's funny - the trailer doesn't really capture the mood of the film. It is far better than the trailer suggests.
Willoughby killed Angela Hayes
A proper film deserved all its accolades.
Wow! I'm speechless.
What's the name of the song that plays at 0:42?
This trailer is just so hamfisted. I hope the finished product works a lot better.
"""This didn't put an end to cow, you reallying retard; this is just the reallying start. Why don't you put that on your Good Morning Missouri reallying wake up broadcast, BITCH?"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"The female lead is over the top, but it feeds the bloodlust of the people so people embrace it."
Just got back from the theaters! and this movie was one of the best i have seen i highly recommend it to anyone who think it looks good.
2:14 - 2:22 In this seconds you understand the Oscar she belongs to her.!
"Is Frances McDormand gonna win another Oscar after 22 years later ??



Um........Definitely!!!!!!!"
"""SO I KICKED HER IN THE PUSSY!!!"""
≈Ωeljko Ivanek is the best thing in the movie.
Frances McDormand is brillllllliant
Middle aged women using the F  and C word is becoming very old. I am tired of being the psychological waste basket for  these Hollywood Weinsteinos who make these awful films and then inflict them on the world like hazardous waste. I prefer Bollywood films.
Who's come after Oscar nomination
What the really was the point of this movie?
I pray this movie wins the Oscar... (for all of the seven nominations)!!
Sam Rockwell deserves so much more rep
Sam Rockwell stole the show. Truly brilliant performance.
"wow, great movie!"
I hope the Oscars do not snub Casey Neistat for the nomination.

"There‚Äôs a scene when she was fighting with her daughter says : I‚Äôm gonna leave and I hope someone raped me 
And she said I hope so 
It‚Äôs just so sad üòû"
Damn it's that chick from Mississippi Burning

BEST F*CKIN' MOVIE EVER!!!!!!
This movie has entered history !
Here's another review made by someone unknown but talented: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZeK_GAGuy0
Just watched it and couldn‚Äôt hold my tears. Oscar confirm.
Oscar sweep!
Looks awesome.
Anyone know what the second song in the trailer is? Starts at 1:35
I read this is actually based off an incident in Vidor Texas.
Francis deserves an Oscar for this
Whats the song at the end of the trailer?
I hope she wins an Oscar.
Definitely getting couple of academy awards
Frances looks like Laura pergolizzi
Ne yapƒ±n edin bu filmi izleyin ve izlettirin.Hele Chief Bill'e selam olsun.O nasƒ±l bir veda mektubuydu.
I just left the movie theater had dinner and then I had to let everyone know what a good film I thought this was. It's a must-see. I love Frances McDormand she is a wonderful actor. The entire cast does a good job in this film .
really great movie bleat! All must watch now fast!
"I
NEED
TO
WATCH
THIS"
this deserves an oscar.. for .. everything !!
"the film is here 
http://cuon.io/MiDqh"
God awful. The most contrived film in at least 15 years.
SJW bullcow
"I hope there be a sequel to this great movie,i want to see that fekin c***nt get his come up."
Congratulations on the 5 BAFTA wins!
BEST MOVIE EVER.Wish it'll win the Oscar. Frances McDormand is just great in this movie (obviously so is Woody Harrelson)
"Wait, this is a COMEDY? Suddenly I'm interested."
What is the song?
Great movie. I hope Sam Rockwell will win his oscar nomination for his fantastic role in this film.

"Crotch kick reactions, lmao"
"Piece of cow liberal propaganda.

Only watched it for Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson, they are great actors and Harrelson in particular is the only reason why this so-called ""film"" wasn't a 0/10.

Caleb Landry Jones had a great performance too.

Frances McDormand just portrays a psycopathic feminist, also, she's a cow actress, Kristen Stewart probably has a greater emotional range than this old hag."
Came here after the bafta awards no regrets.
reallying horrible movie with a plot that goes absolutely nowhere.  How the really did people watch this and like it ?? Each turn dumber than the last ...
I just watched this. Amazing
"Pure, liberal drivel. Mexican at the first sign and cop calls him a beaner. Black guy at next billboard and cop threatens to arrest him for no cause. Black store owner waiting on late white worker. White sign store guy not ""taking no guff from noone"" with ""racist"" cop then show black guys in the background, like they know the deal. Then pan over and a black lady and white lady are walking together. This movie is a reallying benatton ad."
Shouldn't we get a small discount on the cost of movies featuring Peter Dinklage?
i acc cried the most watching this
"Watched this movie last night. Absolutely brilliant movie. Great plot, superb acting and excellent comic timing. Worth watching !"
This movie has a gr8 message . But i wonder if hes the real criminal or no becuse they said dna didnt match
anyone know what the first song is that was playing??
"Great plot, but the movie was overdramatic. A cop bravely walks across the street, breaks into a private property, then knocks out a random citizen and throws him out the window? The chief was standing there and watching, then later just asked for his gun and badge? The burning of the police station was also a little bit inappropriate."
really this movie really this weird ass sory really the fact that at the end you reallying end up knowing no reallying thing!!!!!!!!!
oh great acting frances
That not excessive swearing. It's reallying compulsive disorder.
Watched this last night and I enjoyed it very much
how the really this cow has 8.3 on imdb? you reallying cucks
This was reallying phenomenal
"9.5/10 I give it a -0.5 because that CGI was just appalling. I could have done it better with my $2,000 PC. It's the fake baby in American Sniper all over again."
"Guys, dont you think that the ending is familiar. I think it is similar to another movie but dont remember which one"
THIS MOVIE IS FLIPPING GREAT!
GREAT MOVIE üíï
That end scene in the trailer with the drive by......... Gangster!
Best Film I've seen in 10 years. Superb. Hilarious. If this does not get best picture I'm never going to watch a film again.
"Watched it last night... what a great well made, acted and executed film 10/10 very very funny."
this movie was AMAZING from the bottom of my heart i really recommend it
reallying Awesome Movie!!!
"definitely one of the classic 
right from the start I was gripped to the story
I really hope this movie gets best picture award 
its amazing to have these kind of movies in the time of CGI and romcons and vulgar comedies"
Just saw it. Awesome!
I watched it twice and I'll watch it again
"Omg i love this movie,the best ever on 2017"
üéµWalk away Reneeüéµ
"Great movie , definitely worth your time"
best movie for this years oscars frances was amazing and both woody and rockwell were phenomenal great screenplay too
a movie with no ending.
Wow what a masterpiece !!!!!!!!!!!
01:40 title and who sings the song?
Is it worth watching this one?
I hope she'll win an Oscar for this
"A great movie, really! I liked it so much, I can't tell you how.

"this is good movie right here, it's been a long time i never saw movie like this arround these days"
"A lot of people don't understand that Dixon's character is gay and that is a turning point in the film most of it revolves under it. The Sheriff knew it and wrote a letter to Dixon to make him come to terms with it. Let go of anger, and from then on everything changes that's a crucial turning point in the film."
"A movie about a liberal mental nutcase acting mentally ill until they get their way in order to pedal more anti cop liberal propaganda.

Don't think this anti-police degeneracy is for me, disliked :)"
Great movie.. Addresses many issues I think.
Sam Rocwell will win the oscar wait for it

They show WAY too much of the movie in this preview. And this doesn't make it look like the kind of movie it is. It's kind of along the lines of Fargo. A dark comedy.

"So this is an Oscar Movie?  What happened to Private Ryan or Titanic?  Nobody makes movies like this anymore its so stupid.  All of these movies in 2017 are crap - Kramer vs Kramer, Deer Hunter - these were oscar winning movies - Godfather 1 and 2,  Return of the King - these were movies worthy of an academy award.  

Every movie compared to the above sucks - no movie nominated deserves an Oscar.   Bad year for Hollywood with huge box office losses and huge talent losses if you nominate these people.

You nominate Meryl Streep yet again - yet she remains so quiet when actresses get raped - and she has seen it all - there is no doubt.  It's time for Meryl to tell the world what she has seen - otherwise she is full of crap."
Blew me away.   Oh God.   Incredible

Am I the only one in the world who really DIDN'T like this movie? So confused while reading the reviews...
Best movie of 2017 no question
"Opinion with SPOILERS: It was a good movie...but still incomplete. I don't pay money to imagine the ending....give me the reallying ending... Did they kill the dude or not?. I don't expect them to solve the mistery of who is the killer since this movie goes beyond that....but still at least give a closure, not this open ending bullcow that is such a trend in modern movies and video game industry."
Waste of money
How a strong woman like that could support all the things from the ex husband big pervert?
Mothereallying masterpiece!!
that's one of the most depressing movies ive ever seen! :(
Frances McDormand WILL win Oscars for this
Masterpiece
Looks reallying terrible
"It was a really good movie actually, better then i expected..!"
this movie is a emotional roller coaster ride
Watched this movie last night. It's excellent.
I just saw it and it was a master piece!
Couple of Oscars.. minimum.
Very Good Movie!

"HORRIBLE ! !!  Can only imagine the kind of mindset this appeals to.  Yeah, peace on earth.  Perfect timing to release after Christmas so we have another year to dwell on this instead."
What a great movie. Story line is real. It speaks of many challenges we face today frankly.
"so Taken female, only she wreak havoc in town rather than on terrorists"
"Greatest movie EVER. I cried, laughed, & cried some more"
To be torturing black folk? Oh Hollywood when will you stop with the indoctrination?
Best film since I have seen in years!
It deserves to win Best Picture at the Oscars
Looks original and awesome.
I just saw this movie. Frances should win over Meryl in best actress for the Oscar. I will say however I still need to see Lady Bird
"If this was based a true story it would have been a nigger loving fat white girl who'd been raped tortured and murdered by niggers, her cucked mother would have said she'd pray that the murderers find forgiveness, the police would have ignored the crimes because they'd been told not to arrest any more niggers. That's why the Jews had to write this bullcow fantasy about tough women, innocent niggers and bigoted cops.
If cops hate niggers it's for a good reason, like they have to keep going to people's parents and saying ""sorry your kids got murdered by niggers"""
"üîµ The movie was AMAZING and it was AWESOME! 
Incredible film! Highly recommend checking it out [ ow.ly/i0Na30h7VrX ]"
"""The lady with the FUNNY EYE?"""
its terrible actually
"What an absolute masterpiece of a movie... a well thought screenplay an amazing cast, just beautiful. It tackles a very dark theme in such a way that it fully respects said theme, but makes sure to give you honest laughs and concerns along the way. A movie that finds the perfect way to connect with the viewer without preaching, but at the end, providing some good lessons."

Holy cow! This movie is reallying amazing to the next level and really blew everyone's reallying minds! Like Pulp Fiction style!
Great film! Has it all.
best. acting. ever.
Learn English.
This trailer is very misleading
"Just saw the movie in the theatre 10 minutes ago and it was amazing. I Hugh,y recommend it it's a,so hilarious and serious as well but I definitely recommend it"
"This film is terrible. Ridiculous plotting, the so called humour does not sit well with the drama and it runs out of narrative drive very early when we realise the police chief has already done everything that could have been done. The scene where the police officer publicly throws a man out of a window and yet does not end up in custody, and the cop shooting himself in the head and the firebombing of the police station are very poor screenwriting."
"Do they not make drama anymore? Why must every film be darkly comedic, as if the subject matter is too much to deal with for the modern thin skinned?"
"Dixon: We've had two official complaints about the billboards, so, actually...

Willoughby: From who?

Dixon: A lady with a funny eye... 


Willoughby: A lady with a funny reallying eye?... Jesus Christ."
"Mildred Hayes: This didn't put an end to cow, you reallying retard; this is just the reallying start. Why don't you put that on your Good Morning Missouri reallying wake up broadcast, bitch?"
This movie sucked
"(SPOILERS) An old friend recommended this movie to me and my first comment to him was that the trailer made it look like a chick flick where the men are portrayed as either cucks, morons and villains, as it turns out my instincts were right on the money. This allegory is a testament to the dying patriarch in our country, highlighted by the dying sheriff coughing up blood on our female protagonist. One of the few nice guys that cowed to the alpha female lead is beaten and thrown through a second floor window. The racist evil male deputy is burnt alive by the female lead and only redeems himself when he gives himself over to her cause. The backdrop to this tale is the dead daughter sacrificed to the male evildoers, this alone allows the female lead to burn a police station, drill though her dentists thumb and cause mayhem through this tale unabated, her ex is portrayed as a typical asshole ex' in these chick flicks even though his daughter was killed under his ex wife's watch, half way through the film his ex wife seems to lose another daughter after making her walk miles into town, she is never seen or heard from again in the film."
"This much like Seven Psychopaths has, on paper, all the necessary ingredients to be as good as In Bruges, but neither move grabs me at all. It even has some of my favourite actors like Sam Rockwell...the locales, the perfect casting etc.....but I don't feel it at all :(

I think it's the delivery of the american actors...it just doesn't land like Gleeson and Farrel's Irish. I think if the actors were british it would land better too....it has that kind of tempo and tone that fits well with british comedies...these american characters just don't feel funny...

Does anyone have the same experience?"
Wow that movie looks racist and also promotes hate !
This movie was amazing!!
"""Why don't you put that on your Good Morning Missouri f***ing wake-up broadcast, bitch!"". Frances is the s**t!"
"Good, no politically correct"
This movie kicks ass!
"Unbelievable good movie. And the music. Wow!
""A lady with a funny eye"""
I really wanted this movie to be great...
I have to see this!
this movie is NOTHING like the trailer. They threw in all the funny parts. Literally. I don't think there was a funny part that isn't in this trailer.
"Best movie I have seen in awhile. Great script, awesome acting."
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇlove love this movie!!!! brilliant job!
"God, this looks amazing!!!"
"This looks terrible, but I like Woody Harrelson"
"Absolutely in love with this movie...in the sea of stupid Hollywood ideas for the next blockbuster,this was refreshing and delightful to watch..."
Anyone who thought this movie was good is insane. This was some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a movie. He really didn't realize the fire behind him? He actually put a bag over his head? She can say the N word because she has a black friend who literally has 4 lines in the entire movie? Come on people... Ladybird was just as garbage but at least the acting was good.
"First it was sooooo boring. After, when the black sheriff arrived I thought that it will turn to a very good film. But no. Still cow. Good actors, but no story."
This movie is so good! Watch it!
"Anger begets more anger, and forgiveness and love lead to more forgiveness and love. 
Mahavira"
"As soon as the ""black folks"" line came up, knew I didn't want to see it. THANK YOU for putting your political convictions up so those of us normal people can avoid your films. Do it in every trailer!"
"Amazing movie!!  When somebody awakes and realizes that hatred cannot be hold forever, something great happens.. Thank you. Greetings from Argentina."
"reallying awesome movie!! 10/10. If you loved In bruges, keep in mind this is the same director, and it shows!"
Midgets lol
What does the 3rd billboard say??
Woody Harrelson deserves best supporting actor for his role in this film
looks like a stupid movie
"Well... Margie sure changed a lot since Brainerd, didn't she?"
"1:59 - Ray: ""Bottle! No, don't bother!"""
"""Hey reallyhead!""
""What?""
""Don't say what Dixon when she's calling you a reallyhead!""

That line itself deserve an Oscar üòÇ"
It's superb. Hilarious and sad.
"This movie could've been great but there are just too many things in it that don't make sense-
(Spoiler Alert):

1) Despite the billboards being out of commission for decades and the company who owns them not even knowing of their existence, they still charge Mildred $5000 for a month and she doesn't even try to haggle! What is she, a kid?
2) Woody Harrelson is dying from cancer yet looks completely healthy throughout.
3) Woody has a foreign and much younger wife; the background to which isn't explained at all.
4) Woody's Police interview technique. As with all movie cliches, there is no tape-recording of the interviewing or any video, there isn't another person present, and he's standing up leaning over her, menacingly, as he's speaking to her. In a modern country in 2017 like the US this would not be allowed to happen.
5) After Jason throws the guy from the window, causing him major injuries, it is witnessed by a Police chief and Jason isn't arrested, at any point!! He's just fired, like you would a Burger King employee who's late too many times.
6) The potential rapist who threatens Mildred in the shop- why?! There is no motive at all for him to come in and do that.
7) Mildred's amazing ability, despite her being a gift-shop worker, to fire-bomb a Police station with the skill, precision and expertise of an experienced Commando, like she's done it thousands of times.
8) Mildred gets away with attacking the dentist, despite him having an unusual injury that he would be very unlikely to sustain by himself. The interview is stopped because Woody is ill- so why wasn't it continued by another officer at the time?
9) Jason is allowed back into the Police station at night, by himself, after being fired. 'You've got your keys, just let yourself in,' he's told. Really?! After being fired? You'd surely go to his house and collect those keys, or at least change the locks.
10) Mildred experiences no consequences after attacking teenagers, with lots of witnesses around.
11) The billboards are on fire and Mildred, driving past, just happens to have with her a 50-liter fire extinguisher- very handy. And after the fire's put out, only the paper has been burnt, but the wooden structure is absolutely fine. Hmmm.
12) Why didn't the cops, who we're told have no problem with doing serious stuff like torturing people, simply rip down or deface the billboards in the beginning? They are far away from anywhere, with no residents, CCTV etc.
13) No proper investigation into the arson attack on the Cop Shop.
14) Jason turns from a psycho into a saint, despite undergoing significant trauma."
"Just saw this movie a while ago without knowing anything about it.  Yep, for sure Frances Mcdormand will get nominated for an Oscar, most likely even win it.  I think Sam Rockwell should also get nominated and win Best Supporting Actor (although I still have to watch other actors/movies).  If this is an original screenplay, it should get nominated for that too, and the score was excellent, so I‚Äôll nominate it for that as well!  And, whatever, if it wins all of the above, why not win Best Picture too?  Sam Rockwell, though!"
¬°Wow! ¬°Es genial!
these public servants work for us. f*** them if they can't take a joke.
This was so much better than I thought it would be!!!
so this wedding 3 horny girls sneaked in look for some young signal men help themselves pinching their buts with guys just didn't want to bother with these strange young slut's . the girls often gave glipes at their  nipples or rubbed the crotches of guy siting next to them and with all the me too bull cow they were finally feed up with the double standards they been feed sense before highschool. they feed up and beat them up give black eyes knocked some of their front teeth out and broke their nose's the groom didn't participate but he grinned watching this. the bride seemed mixed look her of just desserts
"Seen the movie , it has some serious reallying problem with REALITY !!! The script writer loves fairies over it I guess, Or else it‚Äôs very good movie wrt direction and the dop, bg scores, acting ...btw I really want to kill that old pumpkin faced bitch dunno why üßê just so disrespectful from all aspects !!!! really !!!"
Sam rockwell is the true hero here. just give him oscar already. it'll be devastating if he doesn't win.
Must see!
0:35 song?????
She deserves the reallying Oscar !!!
"I will always love Kurt Vonnegut. But my new favorite writer is Martin McDonagh.

Last night, I saw ‚Äú3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.‚Äù I‚Äôve never seen a movie where I‚Äôm crying, and I‚Äôm not done with the emotion of crying, but find myself laughing anyway.

I thought ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù was the best movie of the year. And I still think it might very well be the best movie of the year. But I don‚Äôt know anymore.

‚Äú3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚Äù was such a knockout I feel like cheating on my commitment to ‚ÄúGet Out.‚Äù

Greatness is odd. There are degrees. But once you touch greatness, the joy of being in the audience has to be shared.

If you see 1 movie this year, see ‚Äú3 Billboards.‚Äù If you see 2 movies, see ‚Äú3 Billboards‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet Out.‚Äù If you see 3 movies, skip the 3rd movie, get Hulu and see ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.‚Äù

After you watch ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale,‚Äù you‚Äôll never be able to listen to someone like Mike Pence or Ted Cruz or Tomi Lahren without memorizing the fastest possible route to Canada."
"I have got to see this movie, I love writers that have the balls to stand up against Political Correctness and say really IT, I'm going to say what I really feel I don't give a really who I offend."
Corn!
"Think before you watch this movie. Why do Hollywood movies that portray this kind of violent anti social behaviou?.  Anyone who watches this may be impressionable and believe that this is the way to solve your problems, all this sort of conduct will do is LAND YOU IN JAIL.  Yes this sort of media does affect you, do some research.  If it desensitizes you to violence on the screen it will do so in real life. 
Violence, no matter what some angry conservative will tell you does not solve anything, it only creates more problems than it solves.  And before you tell me that it is only a movie and that it is not real ask yourself why you think this kind of movie is okay."

"Great trailer, even better film."
So hateful and bitter and edgy and detached from reality it's kind of funny
One of the best films I've ever seen
Looks great! Where has a character like this been hiding my whole life?!!!
I NEED TO SEE THIS
Hahahahaha rly want to see this
Lets give her a Oscar
Body somewhat game stone nearby at relevant judge urban pop.
"A GREAT film, intelligent, moving, funny, I highly recommend you see it."
This movie deserves every oscar on the list of the oscars! I want them to win them ALL !!
I have to take a dinkledge
This was amazing. 10/10
I don't think they went to kill the guy in the end. The message the movie is trying to bring out is Anger only begets more anger. Anger is like a monster and you will only be trapped in it if you try to fight it. Using anger to manage anger will only brings more problem and trouble. Learn to let go.
"Too many reallys given, sorry"
"Dixon, I'm in the middle of my goddamn Easter dinner. Sorry kids. 

Sold."
frances mcdormand deserves to get her case solved after all that she did in fargo
Great movie
"""You don't say 'What' Dickson when she comes in here calling you a reallyhead"" - hahahahahahah. This movie I must see. And, of course, it helps that Frances McDormand is in the lead"
"Wanna go see this movie next week?   Kinda rough, but I love Francis McDormand.   (Fargo).  Movie, and Lou`s.    Is it a date?"
"Had to go in the middle of the week at 2.30pm and the place was half packed, great film good balance of the tragedy and comedy, well worth a watch if you can"
"We went and saw this yesterday.  Brilliant!  On every level.  
We're taking more folks to see it this weekend.  
Do yourself a favor and see this film...thank me later."
"Wow! I read the plot synopsis and was hoping to see this. Then I watched this incredibly gratuitously vulgar trailer and will never go near it. If this is what passes for entertainment today, I'll pass. All mean spirited gratuitous violence and hate-spewing."
Radiation us extremely gallery newly board stone pot drug media express
great film
More politically induced nonsense lol.
"What is the name of the song at the end of the trailer, is also played in one key scene... ?"
Came here after watching oscar nominations.!!!
"Martin McDonagh robbed by the academy of a director nomination.. makes no sense. gerwig nominated for that crap fest lady bird and Nolan for Dunkirk. I love Nolan, but he's been more amazing than Dunkirk. why do they now decide to nominate him?? and Jordan Peele... ugh... soooooooo stupid"
Caleb Landry Jones is the best thing in this movie.
I freakin love this movie.. üëåüèªüòç
"Gosh, this movie is damn good. Made me laughed and cried through out. Loves Sam Rockwell!"
Frances is ugly as really
Were any actresses molested during the making of this film?
You can't tell me that's not William Dafoe dressed as a woman wearing a wig.
Hollywood loves to hate Middle America.  This is just more garbage from the masters of garbage.
Frances McDormand is one of thee best actors - and she gets better every year.
"Why can‚Äôt a Latina, Asian or Black lead a great story like this in the US? Love Frances btw"
"Saw the movie last night. I was a good movie but to me not a great movie. I love the plot but the execution was kind of predictable. Overall it felt a bit TV show-ish. Frances McDormand is becoming typecast as the ballsy no-nonsense scorned woman in redneck America and her acting is pretty predictable and stiff. She lacks to depth and range of Meryl Streep in my opinion but she is pretty damn good at these ""Fargo"" roles. I think the movie tried a bit too hard at making some of the characters overly quirky to give the movie an edgy feel. Woody Harrison has never been a good actor and he wasn't that great in this one either, very typical over the top acting. The one scene I questioned was when McDormand and her son are driving at night and they come across the billboards burning and right away they ran out with fire extinguishers. Did I miss something? How did they happen to have the fire extinguishers in their car at that very moment? Anyways a 6.5 out of a 10 for me."

"""Don't say ""What"" Dixon, when she comes in calling you a fkhead!""  lol"
Kick her in the pussy!
"SWEET BABY JESUS - do all these commentors work for FOX SEARCH LIGHT FILMs ???

this movie looks totally stupid.... and Francis Mcdummass struts around like the most entitled white bitch ever......

Oh Hollywood tis the season to congradulate yourself...bunch of wankers!"
It‚Äôs amazing
ahahaha this looks fantastic
Great movie!
The second Oscar for Ms.Mc Dormand is obvious at this point ! üëåüèø
God I love this woman ! McDormand is in a league of her own .. both off and on screen
saw it yesterday. A lovely film but the end leaves you hanging....
"calling now, an oscar for Frances and Sam"
Great movie. To bad so many people say it's hard to find it playing anywhere near them.
"Don't say what when she calls you reallyhead hur hur so funny cuz the'r police and he's so dum omg that's funny! I laff everytym hahaha

If that's your reaction that's fine. This movie might be for you. For the more discerning moviegoer it's just weak dialogue trying to get a cheap laugh.Three billboards does that a LOT."
Reminded me of all those movies from the 90s that people drooled over. I don't do quirky.
"Nice work, Ms, McDormand!"
"THIS IS NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  BENNIT DOES THIS BECAUSE HE IS A PSYCHOPATH.  ITS HOW HE SYCHOLOGICALLY DEALS WITH MAKING ALL THESE cowTY MOVIES.

No point watching that movie. Just seen all the best stuff in it........Im reallying fuming. What a reallying spoiler alert trailer
Torturing black folks? A little on the nose with your political narrative movie.
One of the best movies I‚Äôd ever watched
In Bruges' is one of the worst piles of crap I have ever seen.  '7 Psychopaths' wasn't much better. But this was a masterpiece. I couldn't believe it was the same film-maker. An amazing movie.
I just watched this.... loved it. Worth it. Ahhh OMG
Just watched the movie. Hands down the greatest piece of cinema made
Great reallying Movie!!
Such an amazing movie Sam Rothwell was amazing best movie I've ever seen

Van from TMZ the black guy made me look this movie Up
"How they cram so much on one little reel always amazes me. Showed me feelings I thought were only real in books. Actors, how do they do it? It's as if they actually feel what they are acting out. And don't get me started on the music. That song in the opening scene opened up more than the movie for me. 
While we are on the subject of billboards, I wonder if I am allowed to say really, piss or cunt on this here? Anyone have an opinion on that? Anyone? Anyone?"
I vomit at this kind of movie and bossy Frances.
I have got to see this!

Thought it was Christopher Walken on the thumbnail...
Brilliant film and not every story has an ending where they catch the bad man....life i suppose ....great movie
"Really wanted to see this ........uuuuuuuuntil I saw this trailer.  If the trailer has this much profanity, I can only imagine how much the movie has.   I can understand the use of SOME profanity to set the tone of a movie or create a character but good grief, who actually talks like that??? If the old saying is true about profanity being a substitute for intellect and vocabulary, these must be some of the dumbest characters to ever grace the silver screen.  So once again, Hollywood misses out on the money of millions of movie goers by over saturating two hours with f-bombs and other profanity."
"""OUTRAGEOUSLY ...FUNNY..!!"""
She looks like Christopher Walken in The Dear Hunter with that head-band.
Seems like a good film to me....

"Just seen the movie, whilst it was great imo, it also was a bit deflating in the end. Worth a watch for sure! Unfortunately though, the good parts of the movie have been thrown into this trailer. However!! That being said, like I said before worth a watch!"
I'm going to see this! That much is certain.
Un film de violence pour la violence : aucun int√©r√™t.
What a brilliant film this is by the way.
Is this a crime drama or a comedy?
This is an 18 in America? Jeez
"Great movie.
Darker than I expected"
acting was flawless. really didn't like the ending at all.
Seen it last night.good movie full of miserable cunts tho.

"I really like it. Francis, Sir Woody and Sam are great (as usual).
But I found myself slowly turning into my mum...what's with the usage of the c word every 10 minutes?!?!
Good film though, go check it out!"
This film is superb no ones mentioned the scene where the priest is in her house very subtle üòú
no not right for me
Great Movie. About bloody time. So much crap out there. Well done.
This movie blow my mind. I did not see the Oscars for 2017 but somehow i felt that she must have won it! What a movie!

https://thehothundred.blogspot.co.uk/ <‚Äî would really appreciate it if people checked out my bite size review of this film and other recent releases! Thanks in advance
Perfect movie!!!
Amazing film!
Best movie I've seen in years
"Glad I saw the film before I saw the trailer. I hate trailers that show almost the whole film. Good film though, really enjoyed it. Mildred was one mean bitch. Great character and a great actress playing the role."
"this movie was THE cow! Take your predictions while you're watching it, and shove them up yours because they're not gonna be of any use to you! <3"
I‚Äôve just seen this... what a film! Loved it.
Straight to the top of the watchlist
"Seen this last night, best film I've seen in aaaaages!"
Frances McDormand rocks. She really does.
best movie of 2017
I watched the film last night in Oxford UK. Its a great film. I laughed so much. (It was only later that I realised it was a black comedy).
Glad I did not watch this and read the movie directly
This looks good.......real good.
I need to see this movie!
Love this movie so much !!
Cops are winners ... reallying whore and reallying bad violence movie
"THIS is by FAR the worst film I have ever seen in my 57 years. It is SO boring, nonsense, violent, racist, no story, is ha no meaning at all. IF it gets more than ZERO Oscars, there is no fairness."
"Seems like a lot of swearing and a higher than average variety of people being punched,  kicked and pushed out of windows. I hope the film is better than the trailer. It‚Äôs supposed to be."
Spoiler: To me the killer was Sheriff Willoughby. that's why he killed himself and also the other badass guy someway was friend of him. It would explain why they never found DNA matches and a clean criminal record.
Bad film ending not finding killer but go off to kill someone else who deserved too die was good up to the cowty end.
real good movie... the ending thoughüò©üò©
"Saw this Last night,  Wow Movie of the Year.  Beautiful Acting, Script and awesome Soundtrack"
I really wanna see this one I love Frances amazing cast this looks great
2:15-2:22 That comment is gold!
Omg yes colter wall sleeping on black top
And the Oscar goes to.......
"Moral of the story is the police force is no longer the force that protects or helps us sufficiently, that's why a movie has been made to show the truth to a world wide audience. ""You want anything doing? You gotta do it yourself"", these times we are living are very dangerous and we need solutions to correct the wrongs before it all gets further out of hand creating more chaos dragging us deeper into the pits of hell"
"Just came out of this movie 2 hours ago and I‚Äôm still trying to process what I just seen, it‚Äôs only January and it‚Äôs probably the best movie I‚Äôve seen all year. Cannot praise Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand enough üôåüèª there were scenes were the audience erupted with laughter, then there were scenes when you could here a pin drop and and I‚Äôm pretty sure you could here a few people shed a tear or two, well done Martin McDonagh you‚Äôve outdone yourself üôåüèª"
1:58 that scene was so beautifully done in the film.
Music?
What is the sound?????üôèüèª
One of the best films I have seen in ages & this will be a classic for it is timeless! ü§ó
I'm watching this at the theater today! üòÇüòÄ
very nice movie but not a very satisfying end for my opinion
"This looks awful, the main charter just seems to be angry and a pain all the time and also a little bit psychopathic i mean you have a good excuse fair enough but senseless violence is where i draw the line for that excuse"
Just wet this world needs holly weirdo s
"Great movie great cast stupid director good movies have a beginning, middle and end .quick mate re shoot the ending before word gets out"
I wanna watch it so bad now. I mean it has to be good to beat all the other great movies at the GGs.
cant find this film on thetres near me :(
This looks amazing!!
one of best movies lately !!!
funniest trailer for a great movie
"So overrated. I think some people are just excited that it's an original screenplay (although not much feels very original especially if you've seen In Bruges) and are praising it to the high heavens without real justification. Instead of keeping a serious tone the movie does what a lot of movies do and goes for cheap laughs right from the start - the problem is, it's not a comedy so you may well cringe instead of chuckle at some of the hammy acting and unrealistic dialogue. The ex husband's girlfriend - ""Oh! I kinda need to use the bathroom!? Oh is this inconvenient? I can see it's inconvenient"" Holy cow that's some bad moviemaking.

McDormand can't even order the damn billboard without the scene being hammed up right from the start. But at least she gets to say some swear words! Ho ho! Rockwell's character didn't work either, just comes off as an actor trying too hard. In fact, it's writer/director McDonagh who's trying too hard. And it shows. To anyone who gave up half way through, can't say I blame you. It does improve second half, but not by much. Anyone yet to see it expecting another In Bruges - you can forget about it. But that's just like, my opinion man."
"I understand this woman 
Corrupt cops are doing racial profiling instead of doing the right thing"
"The womean talks and acts just like a communist.
A woman like that should be arrested.
People shoul be educated not to rape and the police should investigate murders, that's all.
This movie looks like some kind of an Amercian becoming a communist revolution or something like that."
The young woman being kicked in the groin is a classic example of rape culture being normalized.
lost it at 1:27
Looks so good. They definitely could've actually filmed this in Missouri.
"This movie beat out The Post AND Dunkirk for Best Dramatic Picture at the Golden Globes? Watching it this evening, it BETTER be as good as this trailer suggests, otherwise the Globes will officially be a joke."
Best reallying movie of 2017 and the oscar winner for 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in quite some time. An absolute classic, well written, produced, shot and acted - brilliant all round."
Somebody knows the name of the song please ?
"WTF!!! Just saw the movie, even though I really enjoyed it...the reallying ending!!! (Again) WTF!!!"
I love this movie so muchhhhhhh
Who reallying cares Frances Mcdormand is an overrated actress bye felicia!
Small miss. A lot of underdeveloped characters. Cplus
EPIC AWESOME MOVIE. Finally a non Libtard movie... And it wins over the fag movie
in bruges was seriously hilarious. can't wait to watch this
"It is one the best movies i've ever watched,highly recommended ü§òüèª"
"so now the leftist media establishment is calling this movie ""racist"". #cantwejustenjoyreallyingmoviesanymore????"
Watched this movie and its terrible. Tries too hard to be like Fargo.
Wow.. Badass....
The polar opposite from the mild-mannered police woman she plays in Fargo.
Can someone please tell me how was this film in the drama category while Get Out was in the comedy category at the Golden Globes?
This movie was reallying terrible
Frances pisou muito nesse filme.
Go get that oscar mrs. frances!
2:16 jesus calm down
Frances McDormand was amazing in this movie.. she deserve Oscar
I can‚Äôt tell if this looks good or bad. I might just watch it anyway because I have a Limitless Pass at Odeon so it‚Äôs free üôà
Seems like Hollywood is running out of movie titles. Been there when I tried to create a new gmail account.
It's a fookin MASTERPIECE.
What is the guitar song called in the background
Mildred For President
https://t.co/WGXNYOftVJ - a great review on the film!
"This movie looks great but where is this story going exactly? Because from the 2:40 long trailer, it appears that the entire movie is about a woman determined to keep 3 lousy billboards up to get police to investigate her daughter's death.... Do they actually show the daughter dying? or is the daughter still alive or something?"
I love Woody Harrelson! I will watch this movie because he is in it and for no other reason
1:28 oh god the minute I saw that I knew I wanted to see it
Is that the guy ( DICK-son) who publicly upload his sexual exploitation with PARIS on the internet?
"Mensch, I love that woman! I have to see this movie, it's gonna be great!"
Saw it yesterday. F-ING LOVED IT!
best movie i ever seen
"At least if I was outside Ebbing, Missouri... I wouldn't be in reallyin' Bruges!"
Gotta see this movie. Great music also.
who killed the girl lol
Bible in 1 hour and 48 minutes
Rednecks take everything into their own hands.
OSCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bow solid ideal lawsuit rock living curious east reality.
Amazing staff didnt see it coming @ 2:14  hahahahahaha
"‚úîÔ∏è Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri M·¥è·¥†…™·¥á
The story was very good! Incredible movie! Highly recommend checking it out! [ ow.ly/i0Na30h7VrX ]"
"And the Golden Globe goes to frances McDormand!!! Well deserved, BRAVOOO"
"this movie was reallying amazing and had everything, jokes, violence, deep dialogues, peter dinklage in a suit. you should definitely watch it!"
Good movie...but MOVIE OF THE YEAR AT THE GLOBES? I don't get it.
She's kinda nuts...I like it. How people handle death is different for each and she just wants some results. A lot people just want closure or just to see justice for the one or ones they lost.
Give Frances an Oscar solely based on this trailer!!
This isn't my sort of movie and I only came here fore Sam Rockwell but this actually looks like it might be really good.
"lots of swearing, so i know americans will love it"
Well. Just watched it.. and it's good.. really good .. But I think 8.4 on IMDB is too much .. I would give it 7.5 max.
Martin McDonagh is amazing...
Why are Americans always portrayed as so rude and crude!!
"This had better atleast come to my local Dollar Theater if it doesn‚Äôt come to the big one which it did. 
Came in Summer for about two weeks at most and then it was gone."
Best Motion picture drama ........üòçüòçüòç
"""It's not over yet you reallying retard it's just beginning, why don't you put that in your morning news program you stupid bitch""

Never laughed so hard in my entire life."
Golden Globe winner this movie is a masterpiece
Screenplay with major vulgar words is Oscar's favourite winner...
What age must i have  to watch this film?
Frances is an incredible actress. Well deserved Golden Globe. Now lets hope she takes the Oscar.
More hate speech movies made by Hollywood
"looks good, hope it not as forced as his other works, but lets see"
"Just saw this today, the acting was phenomenal!"
Best reallyING movie of the year!!
Haha..
When is  it out in Scotland?
My favorite movie of 2017 that's doesn't feature any superheroes.
How about you sweet heartüòÇüòÇ
"The Golden Globes brought me here, and now I see why this film won so much. That last thrashing by Francis makes me want to see it."
"I remember her in Mississpi Burning.
 Long way to hone her craft."
I‚Äôm noticing a trend amongst films and TV shows about Missouri..
Excellent!! McDormand and Sam Rockwell defently deserved their Golden Globe!!!
Just watched it!!! Great reallying movie
"never knew this movie, till they win best picture"
CONGRATULATIONS FRANCESüëèüëè!!!!
And the GOlDeN Globes Goes to ........
I'VE LITERALLY NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE WHY DID IT WIN SO MANY AWARDS
"Best movie in Golden Globes, everyone!"
Don't  ever  really  with a southie  mother
Golden Globes winner for best actress Frances McDormand! and soon to be Academy Award Winner for best actress
Just watching this trailer makes it seems it's a real contender for this year's Oscar for 'Best Picture'.
Golden Globe best Drama let‚Äôs GOOO
Ummm...
Yaaas Golden Globe winners!
A Movie To Watch For........................ Awesome Trailer
"Making my home State of Missouri look Stoopid again...& you shot this in Sylva, North Carolina!! Couldn't even bring your money to Missouri & boost our State's economy."
I didn't know what to go see at the cinema so I decided to pick a film completely at random and I landed on this. Is it any good? lol
"such a cowty film, great actors, but director is an asshole"
"Does anyone else think this movie is a masterpiece?
Best movie of the year!!"
Brilliant movie!!!!
"Saw the movie tonight. Someone please tell me there is a next chapter ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri 2"""
Brilliant Film!!! Just watched it.....
"Watching this trailer just after completing the full movie. 
Movie was good and deserves for Oscars nominee. 
This is worth for watching."
How many F word in this trailer only üòÖ?
"Incredible movie.  Funny, dark, sad and overall a great experience.  Best movie this year."
"This really good movie, randomly watched it and loved it, recommend it to anyone"
Utter crap
"these actors are irresponsible dirty persons ,  how can be dirty talk allowed in tv and movies , this is how they educate people !!!"
"I'm pretty sure you either love this movie or you hate it. If you're one of the people that hated it, there's nothing wrong with that, I just don't like you"
"Saw it today, and I'd give it 9 out of 10 for brilliance on all counts, but must reduce to 8 out of 10 because of terrible performance by Abbie Cornish."
"Warning this movie is diabolically cow dont watch this reallying movie just suicides and misery from beginning to end no storyline at all and one of those bull cow ending where nothing happens nothing reallying gets solved worst reallying movie ever dont see its advertised as a comedy action but its a reallying misery cow box from beging to end dont watch this cow. also this movie is popular as really on rotten tomatoes for some reallying reason because everyone loves misery because they must live in a miserable life like a bunch of wankers. i would rather eat 20kg of albanina sugar-free gummi bears and have endless chronic cows for the rest of my life than watch this cow diabolically bad ending movie.
just a heads up dont watch this cow nothing gets solved complete crap and misery from begging to end"
OMG I love me some Francis McDormand!  Amazing movie!
Can someone agree with me that at the end the ex cop was saying that he knew the killer in Ohio and asked if she wanted to come along? Anyway that was a suicide pact right but made it out he knew who it was basically they both gave up. Any thoughts?
It‚Äôs Deadpool‚Äôs sister.
This movie looks awesome
Willem Dafoe's best movie since Platoon.
"Finally, a good movie coming out. Only took Hollywood a year."
"The main character Mildred wearing overalls and headband resembles a famous feminist poster from world war 2 ""Rosie the riverter' WE CAN DO IT."
Oh look an Irish Marxist cowting on the south. What a shocker.
"Interesting trailer. 
A woman angry,  swearing with a nasty attitude.

This must appeal to a certain audience?"
Great movie! Enjoyed it.
"So disappointed! Most overrated, unfunny and overhyped movie of the year. False character arcs, flat comedy trying to be dark, Trying to be like Coen brothers but fails miserably. I love In Bruges and like Seven Psychopaths so was expecting a good film from him... Reactions of characters in so many scenes was completely ridiculous and doesn't follow how they have been up until that point. All the funny parts in the trailer were edited well but in the scenes of the movie it's a much darker tone and usually after something dark has happened or is happening, so the timing is off and it comes across as forced comedy. I'd give it 4/10"
I reallying love Frances McDormand!!!
"Excellent, can‚Äôt wait. Nothing like a good swift kick in the cnut.."
"Good movie, just watched it. I wonder if they did it at the end. I think yes"
Hey reallyhead hahahah
This movie sucked balls
"Such a great trailer, such a mediocre film. Loads of weak casting, voice-overs, uneven script, terrible soundtrack choices. A shame."
"""The Department's to busy Torturing black folk's""  Within 30 seconds of the trailer......Why the Marxism in Every movie ffs. Another movie i won't be watching."
"I had high hopes for this movie.
Saw it last night........4 outta 10."
And you think there's more violence in Superhero movies.
Great film really enjoyed it
"Easily one of the best films of 2017. Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell deserve all the praise they get, acting is superb and the story grips to the very end."
LOVE THIS MOVIE! AMAZING!!
WOW what a great movie...but where the really is the end?!!!!! I wanted to see justice!!!! WTF!!
This movie was....LEGENDARY! Frances McDormand...all hail!
Looks amazing!
reallyhead that new üòÇüòÇ
awesome movie
I found my movie.
"I'm scrolling down the comments below about the ending to the film and how it never provided closure to the story. However, I would have to some extent agree with this, but I will have to argue that the ambiguity of the ending to me was pretty decent. Even though the main plot point of the film ""wasn't"" resolved with a concrete conclusion, I will have to say that a majority of it was implied through the dialogue. Another situation that the film doesn't answer and

 spoilers 

I can see why it is irritating to end a film right before an important moment and would have provided a more satisfying conclusion if they showed an ending where the men in the bar that were probably responsible for the death of the main character's daughter were killed off by the two anti-heroes. But in defense of the ambiguous ending, I thought it was satisfying to end it that way. In fact, what better way to end it than with them driving off and contemplating along the way whether or not to murder the rapists. It also brought some moment of redemption for officer Dixon and also provided the viewer with some ideas of who murder the daughter"
MASTERFULLY CRAFTED FILM
"Can't remember ever being so invested in a film, it's absolutely brilliant."
Watched it last night..first half was very good but the second half was lame..the ending was stupid and unrealistic
"Saw it two nights ago - it'll win a few Oscars - incredible movie, well acted, great story, you never know what's going to happen next (a rarity in cinema these days)"
If you liked Fargo you will love this.  It's awesome. What great actors
two thumbs up. literally.
I enjoyed this but can't help feeling it would have been better if it was British. I think Colin Farrel would of done great at Dickson although Rockwell was good.
"2:12 clarke reallying peters, hooray!"
OK just got done watching this....GREAT MOVIE ...up until the end...reallyING RUINED the movie....this was SOOO FARGO=esque until the end..... Great story...great screen play....great script writing... but the reallying ending RUINED this movie.... NO revenge....No plot twist... No closure at all..... just PISSED me off so bad i had to write this review so everyone can see the movie...and come back...and agree with me.. thanks
what a gem really enjoyed
What a fantastic cast
"A MASTERPIECE! As much as I laughed my head out, as much I cried too. Frances was simply MAGNIFICENT! And of course, the UNIQUE Sam."
Someone explain the ending to me
How can you even put any dislike this kind of amazing movie?! I don't understand Frankly.
"Starts out really strong but quickly becomes a suspension of reality, read the book ""On Moral Fiction"" you will get the point.

Who can assault high school students and nothing happen, you wouldn't get off the property before you were arrested. Who could fire bomb a police station and just relax across the street smoking a cigarette?

What officer could throw a business owner out of a window and viciously assault him in front of the town and the Fed who was sent in to clean up the corruption and just walk back in the police station and go about his day?"
"Colter Wall - ""Sleeping on the Blacktop"" ... You're welcome. lol"
"*Spoiler (or unsubstantiated conspiracy) Alert*





It says ""S4RGE"" in big letters on the wall behind Red Welby's desk. Coincidence?"
"You'll laugh, cry and deeply touched
don't miss
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
The best 2017 movie"
Such a bad ending smh
2017 GREATEST movie for sure.Thanks.
Now that's a cast
"This trailer makes it look like a dark, witty comedy with some tragic elments, when actually this is a ""gonna really your mind up"" dark movie, with some comedy."
I reallying LOVE Frances McDormand! I wanna see this!
"wow, so many likes"
Omg this movie was so good!
1:27 LMFAO
"Spolier Alert





The chief said that wasn't the guy who killed/raped her. In fact he wasn't in the country, so why was the ending like that? Anyone?"
Yep it‚Äôs red band for sure üëç
So is there going to be a part two or it‚Äôs gonna end like thatü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î
Sam Rockwell to Oscar
This looks amazing
"It should be noted that the working title of this movie while under development was jokingly called: ""Autism: The Motion Picture""."
Where is the movie about the rampant Chicago Gang Violence?
hahaha do not really with this woman!!! Films looks decent.
"""The police are too busy torturing blacks folks instead of stopping actual crime"". Lady, you said a mouth full right there. I'm watching this."
"I'm sure the parents of Morgan Harrington, raped and murdered by a negro after attending a Metallica gig, are quite happy for the cops to ""hassle"" violent negro crims. Even if Hollywood isn't."
450 reallyheads didn't like this trailer
"I'd watch this movie, but I think I just saw it all in this trailer. Good movie....I think."
The song that starts from 0:43 anyone????
OSCAR alert
"I was disappointed. The acting is wonderful, McDormand, Rockwell especially, and Harrelson are a pleasure to watch, but the plot is weak, requiring narrative filler and coincidence to move forward, and none of the characters develops save for Rockwell's and that transformation is not believable (stupid, homicidal racist to compassionate, heroic defender in one scene)."
"Seems they didn‚Äôt know many words that they could write an actual script, just swear words. Might have been a good movie otherwise. Really feel like they think audiences are too dumb to write descent dialogue for."
such a great film!
Ok. This is looks amazing.
"way, way, WAY too much swearing. Why is it necessary? It's horrific."
That woman: she's a real feminist!  üòÇüëèüòÇüëèüòÇüëè
"Damn, I love that lady."
"Penelope said ""begets""?"
this looks so reallying good sjshhss
"YOU DIDN‚ÄôT PUT AN END TO cow, YOU reallyING RETARD. THIS IS JUST THE reallyING START. WHY DON‚ÄôT YOU PUT THAT IN YOUR GOOD MORNING MISSOURI reallyING WAKE UP BROADCAST, BITCH?"
Can't wait till it comes out in January
"Best Picture,Best Actress, Actor, Supporting Actor, Dirctor, Screenplay, and original soundtrack...among others, as far as I'm concerned"
It looks good other than she said cops kill black propel more than finding her daughters killer and come on cops kill more whites than blacks.
"""This ain't put an end to cow you reallying retard this is just a reallying start. Why don't you put that on your good morning Missouri reallying wake up broadcast bitch."""
"How in the really do you write dialogue like this, cow is perfection !!!!!"
OSCAR !!!! :-))
Yet another foul-mouthed movie.
Best screenplay I've seen in years
Boring!!!! Dumb plot.  Laughable dialogue.  Incredible waste of acting talent.  Embarrassing.
"this movie is reallying incredible. Reminded me of one big, long episode of Fargo. Hilarious and brilliantly acted."
Frances McDormand MUST WIN her second reallying Oscar!!!!!!!!!!!!
"seriously, one of the best movies, if not THE best movie, of the year. we're gonna be talking about this one years to come."
Best film of the year
"Pretty much this is aimed at Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona. A sheriff who, yea lots of bad acting and bigotry, but also is known in the courts for harassing and jailing anyone not white and born again while NEGLECTING hundreds of ACTUAL criminal cases. Like murder, assault, rape, child rape, etc. Yea, the State court actually fined the guy for NOT doing his flippin' job. At least, this film seems to me to have that allegory."
"WARNING liking the look of this film but please don't be fooled that this film is a downer on the police. It's actually to mislead the masses whilst the international psychopaths put the finishing touches to their Judaeo-Police State over humanity. Microwave radiation mind control is how they do it. Yours, a black and white Jew and Targeted Individual."
"I talk about this film in my first blog post! Check it out:

https://www.penpsych.com/blog/2017/12/6/in-defense-of-postmodernism-jordan-peterson-social-justice-warfare-and-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri"
This movie looks like it sucks. I'll pass.
i all really love this movie
Movie of the year so far... Logan and Get Out a solid 2nd and 3rd.
"So wait, are people saying this is actually a good movie?  



I'll have to watch it again then lol."
The reallyHEAD scene made my day. It killed me XD
Gotta see this!  Love Frances in everything she does...brilliant!!!
lol now THAT lookslike a good movie
Just saw this movie: it's brilliant! Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson should be getting awards for this. Sam Rockwell also pulled off a flawless performance
This film is a raw masterwork. Loved it. Wicked funny. McDormand cements her place in the pantheon.
"Just saw it. One of the greatest of all time. So many genius actors. Woody Harrelson is a miracle. Frances McDormand kills it. Sam Rockwell has a difficult role and never falters. This is a very emotional, complex, intimate, unique film that engages you completely from the start. In a sense, it's a whodunnit and a thriller, but also a movie about family love and dysfunction, and surprising friendships and alliances that arise during times of crisis. Wow across the board. You'll love it! Oscar sweep!"
Bout time someone brought Frances McDormand back
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Movie [ ow.ly/i0Na30h7VrX ]"
Just seen it if you're on the fence about watching the movie i am pushing you over This is the best movie i have seen all year.
This bill board movie is about a death of a female like CHANDRA LEVY!   when the congressmen get rejected they then change the conversation to Chandra levy in DC.... now we know in act I:  wayne Williams was a DJ who serial killed African kids and what happen all over the usa there were bill boards put up bye the African ministers soliciting money to find this white KKK killer of African youth.   THe money flowed in and then they arrest WAYNE WILLIAMS the DJ talent scout who killed the KIDS... was that 3 bill boards down DC?   yet act II was malvo or wayne Williams with muslim Williams  and he killed his first DC kid a 10 year old coming to school late using malvo as wayne Williams it was the DC SHOOTERS.   then act III this was when Obama saw the effectiveness of malvo and muslim Williams then he order the mass entry of malvo's into the usa via mexico etc alone as children... then they become wayne Williams MALVO!!!!   ACT III of Obama as muslim Williams and all the kids that came into the usa ALONE....  that is the ploy of the elected in DC...   CHANDRA LEVY was the lady's MOMMY...   never forget the world of a three act play!!!
Trailer looks good..... going to see this tomorrow. Can't wait....
Frances macdormand deserved another oscar for this movie
Song?
I'm gonna watch today
"Can't wait, looks like a masterpiece"
This is the cow !
This looks awesome..
It was really good
MAYDAY MAYDAY! WE HAVE A MOVIE HIT HERE!>. PS> ANNDD THAT KICK .... OHAHHHAH I FELL OFF THE CHAIR! :D
"just saw it, it was great."
Yes!!!
I am here for it!
"As someone who saw three billboards, the trailer spoils most of the movie"
This film was great! Best movie of the year easily. Loved it!!!
CAN'T WAIT TO MISS THIS ONE! THANK GOD FOR PREVIEWS!
Just saw it tonight and it was so good! Great performances throughout.
"1:23 niiiiice cuntbust üòÇüòÇ I really like cuntbusting girls,once I grabbed and squeezed hard  a girls pussy from behind  and she screamed loudly that was very hot  üòÇüëçüèº"
Good movie but the ending was a bit cowe and underwhelming.
Cant wait for the perfect bloody shootout?
YAAAAAAAAS BITCH!!
Saw it today. A must see. Oscar worthy in so many ways. A very dark comedy that hits on some touchy subjects.
This movie was actually pretty good!
"I guess the cast interview for this film is the last one Charlie Rose will ever do for a TV audience. ¬†: ) Dumb SOB was slobbering on himself while he interrupted his guests. ¬†Hey kids, remember if you wanna be a big ""TV personality"", continually stroke celebs ego as you TRY HARD to CONTINUALLY equate the quality of your work (as a talking head) to their work. Also, make your female interns (working on ZERO $$$ salary for the ""privilege"" of putting ""Cocksucker For Charlie Rose Show"" on their resume) do ALL your cowwork to prep for interviews----you'll get your Emmy in no time. ¬†Just make sure the celebs rhythmically stroke you back by mentioning your ""importance to the dialogue"" after you stroke them. Finally, remember the old rule of journalistic celebrity: ""One good long handjob deserves a thorough handjob in return"""
What is the name of the first song
What song is that in the background?
I saw this the other night and it totally kicked ass. If you haven't seen it yet you totally should. One of the best movies of 2017
Just a reallyed up movie that made me laugh my ass off.
This is quite possibly the best film I have seen all year.
"Considering how hard it would be to find a rapist and murderer, especially if they skipped town immediately afterward, this is just a movie about a bitter, rude cunt being a horrible cowstain to everyone around her that offers an opposing opinion or doesn't or flock to her camp."
"Oscar time, but in a good way."
"Just saw this movie. The woman married to the police chief had an Australian/British (?) accent. She totally did not fit with the cast of characters and seemed out of place in the movie. Otherwise, let the Oscar nominations begin."
should i see this ???? is it boring
Just saw it... 10/10
"Just got back from seeing this movie, and I feel like it lived up to the trailer, while also showing that there is some serious material going on. Frances McDormand was incredible as Mildred."
OMG. Such a great movie!!!!
Oh my! Now SHE  is a character!! I will definitely check it out.
I think I'll be skipping this film.
"Started off good, got boring by dragging out, picked up again for the better, ending was a huge disappointment, left a huge hole. For the storyline and the R rating you would think this movie would have been extremely darker and showed a little more rage from the main actress. If I was in this situation with my daughter I would have raised ABSOLUTE chaos. I get it, there was meant to be some comedy in it, but it shouldn‚Äôt have over shadowed the drama. The actors were good but the story wasn‚Äôt great at portraying vengeance. Once again with an R rating I thought it was mediocre at best, doesn‚Äôt deserve any awards. Saw it last night, my thoughts: Honestly I think this movie would have been better with an all black cast. Would loved to have seen Taraji P Henson in this role. Skip this one and wait for redbox!!"
I'm here from the super mega podcast
"one of the best movies in a LONG TIME, life lessons, comedy, saddness, mother love, honor"
And Clarke Peters (blink and you'll miss him).
DON'T TAKE DRUGS!
Looks like a pile of white trash cow movie
2:14 reallyin A. I need to see this movie when it comes out in Sydney.
She makes Melissa Mcarthy look like a wannabe
That dentist probably wanted a 'do over' for that day.
"reallying loved this movie. really all priest, most of all really all sandy hook parents who lied about the shooting. Nobody died, none of the parents acted like the character in the movie."
postal the movie
really yeah!!!! this looks awesome.
"I just watched this movie ,I can tell you ,maybe it's not the best movie of 2017.But for the performance of McDormand and Rockwell,it's totally worthy.I'll say Rockwell may win Oscar best supporting actor for this."
This movie was amazing! Highly recommended- rotten tomatoes gave it 95%
This is raw.  I reallying love it.
"""Hey reallyHEAD""
""Wut""
""DON'T SAY 'WHAT', DIXON, WHEN SHE COMES IN CALLIN YOU A reallyHEAD"""
"IS GREAT, it is Funny, Hysterical, Sad, Brutal, and everything in between. The cast is excellent, Francis is deserving of an Oscar nomination  really. I ended  up crying too at the end. so powerful in parts that it moves you to tears or fear too."
Seems to really paint White small town America in a negative light.
AHHHH! THAT'S MY TOWN! THAT'S WHERS I LIVE!
"I said whoever threw that can, your moms a hoe!"
So it's red band because they swear? Aight
"I enjoyed this movie.  However, I felt like the dialogue was horrendous.  For some reason they overly curse in every scene.  I have no problem with curse words.  But it just felt so forced and not authentic.  It's like they were trying to make people think these are grimmy people so they have to make them shoehorn curse words in every scene for no reason.  And then they do these shoehorn these subversive messages in the dialogue.  She just goes on like a 5 minute rant about the Bloods and the Crips for no reason.

But otherwise it was entertaining.  But it could have been made much better."
Looks good.
Three Bill Burrs
I loved this movie!
Where is this actually showing? Certainly not in Central PA!
is this good?
Finished watching it. Great movie!
"Just saw this. Terribly written, mostly lousy acting. Way too much poorly placed gratuitous cursing. Bad direction. Just a compete waste. It seemed more like a high school play than an actual Hollywood production. Seriously don't waste your time. The trailer is much much much better than the actual movie."
Can't wait to see it!
This movie was AMAZING.
"My review for Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Check it out!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWmV8DzvlWs"
and hollywood wonders why it's going down the drain and nobody is watching there movies anymore racial divide at it's finest SMH
"For the first times in I don't know how long, a film has really piqued my interest and I can't find it playing anywhere near me :("
I was dragged to see it by a friend who had tickets so I went. One of thee best movies I have seen in a long time. The writing and the acting was brilliant. I feel guilty for laughing so much. Sam Rockwell will be up for an award (and I can't even stand the guy or his ugly little mug but he really outdid himself in this film).
Pretty damn good movie but the ending was pretty eeeehhhhhh.
I saw this movie yesterday .  ONE OF THE BEST FILM IN YEARS .  AN OSCAR CALIBER PERFORMANCE from FRANCES MACDORMAND
"Was looking forward to seeing something different for a change.
Not after watching the trailer.
The usual Leftist pish.
Even Ireland is lost.
More's the pity."
This movie was so good
I didn't like it
"I got to see this movie in a theatre near me, and I was blown away. Sometimes, small budget films are better than blockbuster films. Also, Francis McDormand is a real actor, not some rich, sexy model who got the part in a movie out of fame."
"This was literally filmed in my town. The whole place was shutdown forever, which was pretty bad for the businesses on main street, which is where this was filmed."
The role Francis McD was born to play...
"Lol this trailer makes it look strictly like a comedy. The movie is so much more intense than what it looks like here. Great movie, just go in with the right expectations"
Why don't these writers and directors ever learn that profuse profanity loses any impact in a movie after about 15 minutes.  Then it becomes just a sign of poor writing and directing.
"""Seems to me the police department is too busy torturing Black folks to solve actual crime.""

This line will probably be overshadowed by all crudeness."
"Wow, I'll surely love this movie!"
"This was filmed where i live, me and my friends got to watch the fire that was in the trailer too."
"This is a great movie, especially if you are looking for a script that avoids every movie clich√© and in which almost every scene goes in a completely unanticipated direction.  In fact, it's probably WAY too good, too subtle, too psychologically complex, and too morally ambiguous to win an Oscar."
"""Hi, it's Marge. Real good then."" FM is AWESOME!"
"more white-guilt, more feminism, more antifa glorification. die hollywood, you miserable anti-white marxist machine."
WTF??? I‚ÄùVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE???? There is no way that this is a new release??
Yes please!
What? You don't say what when she call you a F&CK head. Cracks me up!!!
Never underestimate a mother seeking justice for her child.
pure cow
I swear she is a true savage she started the Savage movement
Brilliant ! Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell both deserve Oscars for this.
"Love Martin McDonagh, Clever British Comedy and heavy themes are seamless in his movies."
"Can't wait to see this. My daughter and boyfriend saw the trailer at the movies and her bf said-""oh look, they made a film about your mom"" lmao."
Yes.üíô Frances Mcdormand I'll be checking this out todayüòÇ

(Puts up billboards) oh okay, a movie about one woman against the police, maybe the town will-(Kicks girl in cunt) Whoa wtf... HELL YEAH!!! This is a movie of a bad ass woman out for blo- (puts guy on fire) WHAT THE really!?! Oh so it's a phyco bitch out for blo- (curses out news caster)........... what?"
Definitely going to see
she is going to win another Oscar!
"""Too busy torturing black folks"".....yeah I can tell this is a movie I'm not gonna like. Keep pushing this bullcow Jews. See if Hollywood doesn't fall altogether."
"why dont you try driving on the right side of the road?  and not kicking the kids.   also, we have developed showers.  ya'll find it in the bathroom.  try using it, even just like once / week.   just turn the knobs and the water sprays down on ya.   and at walmart, they sell the soap.  it'll keep you from looking like you stepped out of a stone yard.   and just in general, go away.   like to nebraska or somewhere.   and stop acting like you have some noble cause.   you dont even have enuf sense to shower and act 1/2 way decent, let alone strive for nobility.  you are a joke.  that's the mo psycho lady, she's always there.   just look around in mo, ya'll find her.   being her creepy insane psychpathic dishonest self."
"a white chick tired of the police....how believable, is this the best story that could be found to show women fed up with police injustice/incompetence, corny white people cow that will win oscars...dark comedy...hmm"
I saw this movie over the weekend and loved it.¬† Superb actors and Frances McDormand was excellent as usual. The audience applauded when the movie ended.
I have always secretly dreamed of seeing a good movie with Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell
Frances going for that Oscar!!
Whats with the midget?

I was sold at the 'HEY reallyHEAD' part lol
I can't wait to see this
"The movie ended with the dude who said he did it, but the DNA proved he didn't because the dude was out of the country when it happen according to his COMMANDING OFFICER?  yet they believed he did it!!! they are driving to UTAH!!!  the new chief said he was in a classified place.  a hint: it involves SANDY!!!  meaning he went to sandy hook? and the crazy kid did not do it!!! and it was another dude? who shot the crazy kid and left sandy hook?    I do not know what sandy he is talking about or IRAQ?   he went to the SAND BOX..  like the phantom of the opera, the fired cop had half his face burned bye mildred..."
"""Don't take drugs!"""
"Cool, Lucas Hedges is in this."
"One thing this trailer leaves out is the constant barrage of casually used racial slurs by both villains and heroes alike, the disbelief of domestic abuse victims, and the extremely stilted dialogue that thinks cursing counts as character development. Save your time and money."
A reallying bottle? Don't bother!
"How awesome is Frances McDormand? I mean, f*&k."
They filmed alot of this in my town so ive been super excited to watch it. I got to see them film a couple scenes like the one where the building is on fire which was so cool to watch and kind of funny considering that the building across from it had a bad fire a while back and completely took out like 2 shops lol im excited to watch it. Im kind of pissed that i didnt get to see Woody. I heard he was really nice and loved interacting with his fans
I bet Sam wished he had stayed on the moon.
"I wish I could like this 1,000 times."
Absolutely brilliant movie.
This looks reallying great
Top of my list.  NEVER< NEVER < NEVER< piss off Frances McDormand.  NEVER.
Anyone else catch the name of the daughter - Angela Hayes (like Mena Suvari in American Beauty)?
Damn this looks good
"Laughing my ass off, loudly with no reallying shame!!!"
I AM SUPER EXCITED FOR THIS FILM.

I didn't know i needed to see this until now.
Here's a new review: https://www.historyandheadlines.com/november-14-2017-review-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/
No
"I know I might be in the minority here but I really detest the main characters, well, character. She's more an extreme anti-hero bordering on anti-villain if not the antagonist instead of a protagonist from what I can gather. I understand her motivations but her ethics are reallyed left, right, and only vaguely center. I'm certainly watching the film, but only for sating my curiosity in where the flying really the films going with this. o.O"
This looks amazing.  Oh my gosh.
Oscar #2 for Frances
This movie is another portrait of justice being replaced with anarchy.  A foul mouth feminist who might be mighty with her fist but not with being a parent. Beating up and insulting people for her weakness is the characters shame. The american public doesn't need a bullcow pro left antifa bully squad to enforce the laws.  It also doesn't need its police to be wrongly portrayed as mindless professionals.
"Oh man, will it get world wide release?
Awards season is so frustrating for people like me who live in the other side of hemisphere."
The movie won't be in wide release until December 1.
Just saw this at the Arclight Hollywood.  awesome movie.
I won't miss this one.
Martin McDonagh is a genius in my book! I can‚Äôt wait to watch this!
This movie was amazing.
"Should've called it ""A Cunt's Story"""
"This is going to win the oscar. Signed, November 11, 2017."

DAMN GREAT TRAILER!!! Wow...
"really, it's not showing in any theaters near me. This looks great though"
RARBG !!!!!
"OMG, I gotta see this on opening day! WOW! Looks FANTASTIC. Not many actresses better than Frances McDormand."
"Looks reallying amazing. Nominated for an Oscar for sure. Hope they come out with some better movies here soon. SO far this year has been slacking compared to last year. Only the Brave, Stronger, Logan Lucky, Wind River, Blade Runner 2049. Looking forward to I Tonya and Sweet Virginia O and Disaster Artist. Love James Franco. Anyone seen anything else or Looking forward to anything let me know.  I'm always looking for good recommendations."

I'll check it out.

I can't wait.  Frances McDormand is my idol.
It's the cunt punt that did it for me.
I cannot wait to see this movie I like Francis and Woody.
"Unusual that this film took so long for it to finally be released. Today is Nov 3, 2017, and it's not out yet."

Saw it yesterday. Wish it was longer. Great film but not satisfied with the ending.
Might as well give the Oscar to Frances Mcdormand right now
The cast looks fantastic. Sam Rockwell is always a must-see.
Can't reallying wait.
it didn't put an end to cow  you reallying retard!!! This is just a reallying start.  Why dont you put that on your good morning Missouri reallying wake up broadcast bitch
I like to think this is a sequel to Fargo. Marge and Norm move to Missouri. Their daughter gets murdered. Marge goes crazy so norm leaves her. Then Marge terrorizes the local police station because she was a former cop and knows they are not seriously looking into the case. It's a little divergence in her character but that kind of cow will do that to you.
Fun Fact! This film will only be in UK and US in early 2018 and November 2017 so AUS will get it in 2019 or late 2018 or heck 2020.
"I CANNOT wait t see this - I have not been to see a movie in 12 years because most of it is CRAP - this trailer got me on my feet cheering - and why?? Because it's written by an Irishman/Londoner - sharp, brittle, witty and not all sentimental - so refreshing after all the schmaltzy/action cowe that's been on in the last decade in the mainstream cinema!"
"This movie is absolutely disgusting and a reflection of the psychotic, deranged nature of the new American mind."

"Ive been waiting for something good starring Frances McDormand since FARGO - And Ive been really disappointed in Hollywood for not giving her more starring roles like this. She could have pulled off so many great roles as heroine or villianess. But Hollywood has its ""Main Actors and Actresses"" that they give all the good parts to. Most who can barely play two different roles well.
Well, get ready to see McDormand take some more awards away from those actors and actresses!"
"I have watched this trailor ten times today and i havent stopped laughing ""bitch"""

I cant wait to see it"

Loved it.

So what‚Äôs the deal with Sam Rockwell and other cop getting it on in the bathroom for a split second @ 2:04
The reason Martin Mcdonagh is such a good writer is that he doesn‚Äôt avoid challenging topics. He challenges the law by calling them out on their bull-crap by stating that they will come to you if they feel like they being threatened but they will waste time when they‚Äôre supposed to be doing their jobs like finding missing people. This is what this film is about! And that‚Äôs what I love about it!
Any movie that uses the Four Tops' version of Walk Away Renee has got to be good
Oooooh I hope Frances McDormand is showered with awards for her performance in this.
"Tough, comedic, has a touch of a history of violence dialouge, I think this might be the most serious , slightly comedic movie ever, keep it up Fox"
felt a little sad that colin farrell isnt in this movie but MCDONAGH IS BACK AAAAAAAAAAAA
"YES, PLEASE!!!"
This looks brilliant
Will there be justice for the SOBs who killed her daughter ?

"Where the hell is Ebbing, Missouri"
"I smell oscars everywhere, Frances MsDormand is surely getting best actress, supporting actor - Harrelson/Rockwell, screenplay, direction(likely) and best picture! 
(Mark my words, this comment will be the top one after the 90th Oscars! :')"
When does/did this come out?
"I'm from St.Louis, so the scene where she talks about cops torturing black ""folks"" instead of solving real crimes! My mouth drop! I was like, someone finally said it!!"
Can someone please tell me the name of the song that starts 30 seconds in? It's amazing
Wouah she's back. And she's gonna get her oscars 2.
The trailer seems way over the top. Hopefully the film is better. Im having second thoughts.
I cracked up at the part when she kicked a high school kid in the balls!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Damn woody harrelson, is killing it in hollywood...great actor"
"OMG! All the strong language! At first I wanted to go to this movie but now I'm not so sure. Frances McDormand is a good actress but she looks like a really unpleasant person in this. I'd rather watch the story about people I can root for or identify with. I think that Ms. McDormand may even be bipolar in real life. If you saw how she behaved at The Emmys and The Golden Globes when Olive Kittredge was nominated for awards, you would know what I mean. She didn't even seem grateful to accept the Emmy Award she won for the HBO movie."
Anyone else busting The Four Tops out on repeat now?
Why in every movie do they give people from Missouri terrible southern accents... That's not what people sound like in Missouri...
I didn't realise that Christopher Walken had a sex change.
John hawkes my bae
Bad ass cast.
"I think right now the Best Actress Oscar is between Frances McDormand for this movie and Sally Hawkins for ""The Shape of Water."" If ""I, Tonya"" gets released before the end of 2017, Margot Robbie might be thrown into the mix."
"I don't hit women. I would never hit a woman, Chlo√´. I'd hit a woman who's trying to hit me with a bottle, that's different, that's self defence, isn't it?"
She might as well already have the Oscar
I am such a dumbass for getting tickets for other movies at TIFF....
"YAY, won People's Choice at TIFF 2017..... go Frances"
Wow.
"Another goddam brilliant, how is he doing this every single time. McDonagh is godblessed"
I! reallyING! LOVE HER!!!! She just does not give a really!! I am definitely seeing this movie for reallying sure!!!!
"I saw it, best film of 2017 so far"
Ahh this is awkward my mother is on the internet now....great!
this movie is so great! amazing acting and screenplay
Fargo meets True Detective Peaks.
"Who thinks Frances McDormand plays herself in every movie she's in and even in the tv series i.e, Olive Kitteridge.."
Martin McDonagh is a comedic genius.  One of the best screenwriters/directors.  In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths both have fantastic screenplays!
Damn you you stole the song from Hell or High Noon.
whe is the release date ????????????????????????????  I will be watching with complete antisapation
Lucas Hedges has a good agent.
I watched the premiere of this movie at Venice Film Festival and it's very good. The critics and the audience appreciated it a lot and it could win the Golden Lion. You should watch it when it comes out.
1:20 - her kicking the girl as well was hilarious!! hahaha...
I can't wait for this!!!

Goddamn Woody Harrelson is in everything this year!
"looks great, sounds great."
"Looks pretty good. Excited to see it, they filmed part of it at my neighbours house, right down the street!"
I love Frances McDormand!!!
Well that's totally uncalled for. The movie itself looks great.
Songs ?
my kinda movie..... can't wait!!!!!!!!
Hey really head.
Could someone tell me the name of the first song in the trailer?
I hope they blow some reallying heads on this movie as usual and at least a Colin Farrel cameo
I guess we're sop suppose to¬† feel sympathy for the main character there because her daughter was murdered but any sympathy I felt evaporated by the end of the trailer. Still have empathy but no sympathy. She seems like a horrible unlikeable¬†human being.
THIS IS GONNA BE - an OSCAR CONTENDER!  BEST ACTRESS FOR FRANCES MCDORMAND  -  BEST ACTOR for ROBERT PATTINSSON in GOOD TIMES .
The cast alone sold me. Shut up and take my money!!!
ship that 2nd Oscar to Frances today...
"This is coming to the Chicago Film Festival this year, and you'll have to fight me to stop me from going."
Frances McDormand deserves an Oscar from this trailer alone.
when is this coming out??!
"Is it possible that Martin McDonagh's inspiration for this movie was the disappearance of Kara Kopetsky from Belton, MO, back on May 4th, 2007, and the disappearance of Jessica Runion on Sept 8, 2016, in the same vicinity?   Both of their remains eventually  discovered in April of 2017, along a rural highway in Cass County, Missouri."
"In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths are both in my Top 30 Favourite Films of All Time, so I'm very excited for this."
Wish this guy made more movies !
Low key one of my most anticipated movies of the year
"Great too see the original actors from seven psychopaths, they all head great chemistry"
I hate that we have to wait soooo long for this movie. I'm so anxious to see it. Awesome cast. It's going to be amazing. Hurry up November.
Any time i see Woody Harrelson i can't stop thinking that somebody should remake Dr. Strangelove and put him in the role that was of George C. Scott. Just for the sake of itself.
"I smell an Oscar contender, and while I doubt this will be better than In Bruges I'm still hyped as really."
"A woman losing her child does not give her the right to assault anyone, least of all children. This woman is blaming the police, when she should be blaming the murderer. This is a really The Police film."
guys she's WOKE as hell.
LOL... My kinda Woman.   McDermand is brilliant
Oscar nod for best actress shoe in
In Bruges + Tyrion Lannister = One Hell Of A Movie.
Can't wait.
"As a Missourian, I've got to see this film!"
This movie needs to be in my eyeballs like yesterday.
I'm callin' it right the really now! McDormand for the Oscar win! :)
This and Dunkirk are the most anticipated films of the year for me.
Frances McDormand is a legend
Oscar nomination for Frances perhaps?
"Welcome to #faux45 's America, foul-mouthed pansies with the violence they can't live without, SO SAD"

"""Don't say what dixon when she comes in calling you a reallyhead!"" Haha
Martin McDonagh is a genius when it comes to subtle comedic dialogue."
"what do you think the scene in 2:04 is about? seems little out of place, is all"
"well, this is already one of my favorite movies of the year, even without having seen it."
"I think Martin needs to stop putting out these ""oh-I-suppose-I-should-make-another-movie movies"
"Everytime I start thinking I have anger management issues, I just watch this trailer and it calms me down again.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Keep pressing 8 to see Sam Rockwell perform a mating dance with his chair.
First time I plan on going to theaters all year!!
Soundtrack?.....
"The song towards the end is called 'Walk Away, Renee' and tells a tale about a woman who is not to blame for an tragic event and should leave well enough alone.
Foreshadowing?"
Why can't it be October already?
When does this come out?
"This looks brilliant but I hope McDonagh takes his next story out-of-America, In Bruges was great for just that reason alone. Seven Psychopaths is so underrated and I will def go see this at the cinema but hey, why not set one in Australia :P"
–£—Ö —Ç—ã! –ñ–¥—ë–º)
Looks like my new fave
I was in this movie
"i loved  IN BRUGES , and i m sure i m going to love this.."
thats an oscar movie... i can wait for this movie..!!!!
We can't get over racism if we keep bringing it up and stop thinking of Blacks being African-American instead of just America if they live in America!!!
who covers.   the. song don't walk away......
When are they gonna release it already?! Award season i guess? I sure hope she gets it for this!!! Haha! That last line kills me everytime!!! I am rural MO through and through and she nails it!
song title?
That cunt punt was hilarious.¬† And the last line should be played at the Oscars!
ALL of the Oscars!
Why did they have to use the same song that featured in Hell or high water? The setting is already similar enough...
"I CANNOT wait for this movie. If you've watched In Bruges, Six Shooter, or Seven Psychopaths you'd know Martin Mcdonaugh is one of the best screenwriters and directors today and this will be a black comedy for the ages. More Coen-esque than the Coen brothers could write themselves."
Peter Dinklage's clip was too short.
really looking forward to this film with this superior caste---YES
Awesome!!!!
"Looks AMAZING!! Similar tone of Burn after Reading. All star cast, erxpect will be GREAT"
what's the song at 0:34?
"0:10 It's the kid from ""Get out""!"
"cant wait to see this. it was filmed in black mountain, NC, right down the road. I did a security job at a house near these billboards. crazy how they can make it look so BFE yet there are nice houses all around there."
and life somehow becomes worth living again! üòä
‚ù§ CALEB LANDRY JONES ‚ù§
2:12 - Clark Peters!!
"Holy cow, what a trailer."
"greatest trailer for movie of all time, hope it's good"
"this is what we go and see movies for,,,"
"This movie is a must see from the get go. The get go being Martin McDonagh, which is the reason I first find out about it. 
Then Frances mcdormand, then sam rockwell, then woody harrelson. I was already in but then BANG! John  motherfreaking Hawkes AND Peter Dinklage?
It's been a while since I've seen such solid work-power in a single movie!"
"yeah, because violence against those you disagree with is soooo helpful"
Ohhhh Emmmm Geeeee! that was awesome.
The Four Tops - Walk Away Renee. I am a hero that you need
awesome.
Frances McDormand for f*cking president
Wow!! Yes!!
Well they got my money on seeing this.
"Although from the trailer the plot seems like it's a basic ""mother getting revenge against the police"" story don't count out a ton of very dark and sadistic twists in the movie...Martin McDonough is one of the all time masters of black comedy, just go watch In Bruges & Seven Psychopaths."
Anyone know the first song being played in the background?
"looks good, that happens when they stopped recycling ideas and came up with original scripts"
Double toasted brought me here
This movie is about femshep and how to use all the renegade options and dialog for maximum effect. I can't wait.
"Coen Brothers meets Quentin Tarantino, add blender = Three Billboards"
Best Actress Oscar nod for Frances Mcdormand?
A friend recommended Seven Psychopaths and kind of demanded I watch it. After a couple of weeks I finally got around to it and it happened to be a night when I had imbibed some really good 'shrooms. Home alone and tripping with absolutely no idea what I was getting ready to watch. Turned out to be possibly the funnest and best cinematic experience of my entire 42 years. Of course that led to In Bruges later. Nuff said right? Pointless anecdote but I can't wait for this one!
Holy cow! What a trailer this chick went savage.
First movie I've actually wanted to see in a long time!
Martin McDonaugh? I'm in
I LOVE HER
yes COLTER WALL. everyone go and LISTEN to more COLTER WALL
the first hunger games was filmed less than a mile from the billboards in the movie
I mistook the thumbnail image for Christopher Walken.
"I NEED to see this movie. Probably several times, in theaters, because I'm quite certain there will be a lot I miss the first two times over."
Does anybody knows the name of the second song?
what the song?
Keep it in the Public Eye
https://www.change.org/p/federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-called-for-in-the-maura-murray-missing-person-case
Anyone know the name of the song?
Any movie starring or co-starring Frances McDormand will be a huge delight. One of my top 5 favorite actors :)
I think I need a change of pants. :)
"In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths are such great films, the dialogue, the bizarre story and the dark humor are my jam.

So I'm gonna watch the cow out of this movie, Martin McDonagh is the man."
"Lol kids got out of my reallying school to be background actors for this film, talk about extracurricularüòÇ lmao"
"Knowing Martin McDonagh, I can't help wondering if its gonna turn out the mother is the killer."
"I mean... she's got the Oscar. Like that's it, right there."
YEEEEEES ! really YEAH!!!! Finally a new Martin McDonagh movie !!!! I was waiting  so long for that moment and the trailer is awesome ! I Can¬¥t wait !
GREAT

Lester Freamon sighting at 2:12

Most underrated actor in the game. WATCH HIS TWO MOVIES!!
She's going to get an Academy award for this. She's awesome.
I thought only black fellas were drug dealers?
"Of all the heroes you could see in a media, this mother is the most badass one ever depicted.
She's more badass than Batman, and a lot of people are gonna get triggered when they see this production."
she votes Trump and she has more balls that libtard asswipe Clinton.
I've officially watched this ten times now and it doesn't get any less entertaining than it was the first time I saw it.
I love watching Frances McDormand swear.
"Brilliant, just reallying cunting brilliant!"
I love woke white people
The redneck atomic blonde.
"1:16, wow, she went all Ron Artest on the beer throwers"
"they filmed this across the street from my house in black mountain, NC. it was chaos. can't wait to see how it turns out"

"sets building on fire with man inside, drills a hole in a dentist, assaults children, insults the police, still not in prison. Yup sounds like a feminist to me."
This is the worst movie trailer I have seen in a good long while. I certainly won't forget this movie...
I will be attending this movie
1:52 I thought it was DJ Qualls for a second.
"""memorable quote from the video"""
this looks good
This video won't load
"Being from Missouri, I'll have to check this movie out. Looks like a good one!"

Frances McDormand Oscar #2
Frances McDormand Oscar #2
Seems like bad acting
"Unfortunately. in Russia, this great film will be ruined with terrible translation :-("
They had me at the can throwing question.
I remember when they were filming this movie in my town lol didn't know it was gonna be an actual big movie.
Of course they had to make it all about cops arresting black men.
"""FOX SEARCHLIGHT?"" DAMN IT!!!!
I wanna see this."
:)
This is why I love Frances McDormand! When is this reallying movie coming out?????
holy crap the director of Psychopaths AND this cast? im excited

Lol she kicked her in the vagina.
"Representing Sylva, NC where this was filmed! Anyone else? üé¨"
Thats how you do a reallyin trailer.
Oh yes! Love McDonagh. In Bruges was funny af.
That lady embodies every Missourian I've ever met including me
"Well that's a stupid title...
MARTIN MCDONAGH???!!! clicks that cow immediately"
It sounds like she has Tourettes.
"Holy motherreallyer, I can't wait to see this cow."
Police hating now financed by your friendly Hollywood executive producer.  Brace for the next wave of Baton Rouges folks.
"great, another movie I cannot understand.  Why don't they make more movies in english?"
omfg it is my school at 1:20 they filmed it at school
"I remember seeing this getting filmed last May in Sylva and Dillsborough North Carolina and while it looked great during the filming, I couldn't believe the movie's title. Doesn't exactly have the sound of a big box office hit."
what dont you put your billboards up and not kick the crap out of the privates of minors  and the rest of the whole town so the sheriff can do his job instead of arresting your ignorant dumb fuk asz every two mins.
I promise you this will tank....
Could of sworn by the thumbnail that she was Christopher walken
Mineaswell give her ass the Oscar for best actress right now....
I laughed so hard when she kicked that girl in the crotch
Crazy lady antihero. Ok

"""Hey reallyhead!""
""What?""
""DON'T SAY WHAT WHEN SHE CALLS YOU A reallyHEAD""

I honestly didn't come here to expect much I was thinking that it wouldn't be my cup of tea I was just curious but this truly looks like it's going to be amazing drama comedy realism everything that I love
This looks awful.

The book was better
hell yeah!!! a movie with some balls!!
Lol trying to make women look tough.....
Damn this movie's got everything from cunt punting to arson. Best reallying film ever.
let me guess the killer is one of the cops
The only way I'll see this movie is if she dies from gunshot at the end.
#FrancisreallyingMcDormand
This has been my most anticipated of the year and most anticipated trailer of the year
Looking thumbnail wondering if it's a man or woman
I have felt like this woman for 50 years
Crotch kick equality!!!üòÇ
"Exactly, police worried about arresting black people more than white people for the same crimes instead of trying to help actual victims of crimes."
"Trailer of the year, by a wide margin."
Damn it Dixon
This most definitely got my attention
","
This looks fantastic!
can't wait to see this!!
I hope this is a comedy
When you're a crazy bitch and you create more violence to stop violence. Sounds like the far left to me.
yes
"Shoulda finished that last scene with ""really her right in the pussy"""
I AM SO WATCHING THIS. MELISSA LEO AND FRANCES MCDORMAND...... WELCOME BACK. GOOOOOD ACTING IS BACK.
hell yeah martin mcdonagh + sam rockwell? count me the really in.

this looks great
Lol this is in my hometown
Lmfao. I need to see this!
I have GOT to see this!!
can we expect Frances McDormand to return to the Oscars after 11 years ??
only thing missing from this McDonagh film is the classic ol Irishman Colin Farrell. hope he at least makes a cameo. other than that I'm stoked for this
I hope this movie doesn't suck
fargo 2
Can we all just take a second and admire the fact that they used real glass in that door glass shattering scene.... none of that fake sugar type glass that explodes into a million pieces.
Clicked on this trailer by accident but seems like a really good film.
spoilers she is nuts
I got to see this. She's  the female version of Eastwood in Grand Torino. Get off my lawn.
I fooking loved In Bruges and 7 Psychopaths
I'm shook! This movie is going to be so good.
"This looks like it's gonna be good enough for me to watch, despite the fact that it's from Fox"
looks cool
Movie should just be called totall savage looks for daughters killer
""".... or........anus?"""
i saw this in my suggested and i thought it was a joke bc of the title but it seems like a good movie
"Let's all agree that violence is always the solution to your problems. Black Lives Matter, even when I get a C in Spanish. No point in being civilized."
This looks badass as cow
Wow a movie that looks original and could actually be good without having to make 6 sequels.Well played Hollywood well played.
They dindu nuffin nigga.
this looks hilarious! I can't wait to see it
"Hmmm.. I'm sort of on the fence but both my feet are definitely on the side of not liking this movie.
Looks cool, but i feel it is trying a bit too hard. If they dumbed down the story a bit and didn't force out an expletive every 2 seconds because it's edgy, then I think I'd like it. It almost feels like this was an already written story that has had some editing to try and market it to today's audience."
we need more movies like this!!! amazing!
Bro...What A reallying Badass
holy cow...
can't wait till this comes out now. Finely something original and funny.
"They could not have picked a better actor to play the lead (IN BRUGES). The entire cast and crew, as you can see from comments here, have put together other movie gems that EVERYTHING IS SO ""JUST DONE PERFECTLY"", that I cannot wait to see this film...oh yeah!"
Does anyone know the song from the trailer?
"when in the rebellion is a war of a mind with the master so ruthless smarts will be needed when attack the system you need key evadience the samething they use against you the law abuse there power all the time when all need to start sueing them and calling them on there codes with time youll see difference the political field we need to unite and team up state to state we can get together and get in a gang and kill eachother or group up as nerds and out the outsiders as dumb and illtarite we need to unite and feed our own communites taking the position as the government

people wake up before its tooo late like them having rockets going to mars and a harrp machine controlling weather isn't enough"
"lmaooo all the conservatives retards TRIGGERED by the ""torturing black folks"" sentence. go back to your safe space snowflakes"
Only needed a minute of it. Not spoiling any more. Looks great.
I'm seeing this...
Can't wait for this one!!!!
"Looks amazing, like another Kiss Kiss Bang Bang!"
Wow! I think I'm in love with Frances McDermond.
Yep. That's Missouri.
"Holy cow, I just realized that the preacher is played by Art from 'Justified!'  Awesome to see him again, I don't normally spot him in other stuff I watch."
this was filmed in my town!
Cannot wait!
SHE KICKED HER IN THE....... NUTS!
Now THIS looks like my kind of movie!
She could be grrr-eat Boss in possible MGS3 movie.
This looks like pure reallyING gold.
this is what it takes to make a movie now. fantastic!
She looks like Christopher Walken's sister.
John Wicks sister.
"This looks pretty great. I agree with the comment about The Nice Guys, but will say that Hell or High Water had some pretty great writing as well. both are well worth a view."
Wow. This looks great.
billboard's top 10 list
what a name for a movie
This is totally surreal. I'm the dude with the curly hair at 1:23. This looks incredible!!!
Wow... If the movie ends up half as good as this trailer I'll be super pleased.
"Must have filmed this in the part of Missouri that looks like North Carolina. Just curious, why wasn't this filmed in Missouri?"
"I hope this movie does well. I don't want it to be The Nice Guys of 2017. A great, original movie that does little at the box office"
Can't wait for this to come out :)
Is this a sequel to American Beauty?
Lucas Hedges at 1:16. I'm guessing they made the trailer before he was nominated for an Oscar.
—É—É—Ñ—Ñ—Ñ
"Why have you just been showing me all movie? You have to sign that kind of traler like ""The spoiler""!"
"In the meantime, GO WATCH IN BRUGES EVERYONE."
"- is it Fargo or Bruges?
- i don't reallyin' care give 'em both!!!"
"–æ—Ñ–∏–≥–µ—Ç—å! –º—É—Ä–∞—à–∫–∏ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –æ—Ç —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–≤, –≤—Å–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–ø–ª–æ—à–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ–Ω—É—Å—ã!"
FECKING AWESOME!
McDonagh is brilliant. Can't wait.
"cow, This looks awesome."
Carrie Fisher would approve.
Thought it was a Coen Bros. film. Was excited. Now I know it's a Martin McDonagh film. Still excited.
the fuq is Tyrion doing in Missouri
Frances McDormand ain't one to really with. This is gonna be a goddamn masterpiece.
"Argh Frances McDormand, who are you?! XD"
Looks cringey as really.
She's my spirit animal!
"Filmed right here in my neck of the woods! Sylva, NC!!!"
I'd reallying kill this old ugly bitch in a second. reallying annoying cunt.
I wanna see it :D
"I like that there wasn't much Sam Rockwell in the trailer, I'd nearly bet good money that he gets the best lines /scenes apart from McDormands character. Martin McDonagh seems to realise what a star he has as this is their third collobaration."
Love Martin McDonagh! I'm in!
I smell an Oscar.
In Bruges was really good. And thats all. Everything after was worse.
XD Why does such a simple concept look like such a good reallying movie?
I'm so watching this.
"I loved In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths, and I can't wait to see this! :)"
Holy really I love it.
This looks AWESOME!  Can't believe I haven't heard about it until now.  When does it open?
Wowwww! Finally a movie of 2017 I'm excited about!
...wow
"As a southern Missourian, I NEED THIS MOVIE NOW NOW NOW"
This looks like one to buy when it comes out.
"reallying awesome trailer, story, and cast! I'm seeing this as soon as it comes out"
This director + cast!
more people could enjoy your funny movie if u would leave the fs out. They are not funny.
Why am I so reallyin' awesome!?
That looks fantastic
This looks great.
what is taking soooo long for this Oscar worthy film!!!?
This look more Coenesque than an actual Coen Brothers movie.
This cast is my dream team. Cannot wait.
"This looks captivating, I can't wait!!!"
HELL YEAH!! really YEAH!!!! PUTTING IT ON MY TO WATCH LIST !
COLTER WALL!!
Earning that red-band :)
This is going to be amazing. Martin McDonagh is such a good writer. That cast looks pretty stacked as well.
"Seven Psychopaths was seriously underrated! if you haven't seen it yet...do it now! 
This movie looks good! Brilliant actors, raw and unapologetic script, great director...sounds promising, I most def will watch it."
"New Mcdonagh movie, also with Woody Harrelson"

Martin McDonagh for PM !
"Something to look out for, this is amazingly interesting"
