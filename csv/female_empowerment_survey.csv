My ideal team has a clearly defined leader with equal team members. The leader can delegate work to the members and everyone contributes their fair share of work. The leader should be able to know the skills of each team member to delegate work based on that member's strengths. The leader should be a good listener and able to utilize everyone's suggestions into one cohesive end project. The leader should see the clear end goal and don't get too bogged down into the details cause that is where the team members come in.,"Being able to stand next to a male and not be seen as a male and a female with the prejudices that go along with each gender, but to be seen as two equal humans capable of doing the same type of work.",I feel they are necessary for women to have a support group with mentors in fields of work that are predominantly male.

But realistically, we have a long way to go to achieve that.",I don't think there should be gender specific academic or skill competitions.

Knowing that minority men and women do face additional prejudice in many areas of life does makes me hope that groups like these can provide similar support and encouragement, though.","It's not terrible. Working only in these spheres will probably limit some people, but having an arena with less worry of prejudice to dip into could be good for the same reasons I listed before. Note, I'm talking about things like this for genders who have historically been excluded from these skills or activities.

Since there is a lack of women in tech and business, it is important to create groups where women feel empowered to share their ideas and personal experiences so they can continue to grow professionally.","I believe race specific groups provide an even stronger connection for people with similar cultural backgrounds to share their experiences/challenges/opportunities in a comfortable environment. The closer you can get to a person's background and culture, the more comfortable they feel sharing and supporting each other.","I think these competitions should be more inclusive, focused on skills rather than gender or race.

In my academic career, I never considered my performance against a particular gender, but against the entire population.

For example, if I know that my female colleagues are more likely to be interrupted or spoken over in meetings, I can gently correct this behavior (by myself or other meeting participants) when it occurs. We can also structure compensation, performance review, and promotion decision processes to exclude gender biases where possible, so that each employee is judged on merit rather than by gender.",25 - 34,Consultant,No,Male,Bachelor's Degree,University of Texas
"My ideal team splits responsibilities evenly, challenges one another on ideas, and contributes new ideas or ways to do things. Also my ideal team has a mix of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds... I've been in too many teams where everyone came from very affluent families, and sometimes it is difficult to relate.","Female empowerment means that everyone understands that there are inherent biases in our society due to media where women are meant to be more submissive and care about beauty. Once everyone understands that this plague that affects society, we can recognize the bias and truly judge women on their abilities and not what they're supposed to care about according to the media.","I think given the marginalization of women, it is acceptable to have these groups in order to form a camaraderie and honestly address issues. What I don't like about these groups is that they tend to exclude men... at my prior company, our ""Women in Oliver Wyman"" group tended to alienate men from our discussions, which I thought was very counter productive and discriminatory.","Same as above - acceptable due to marginalization and need to address issues in an inclusive forum, but counter productive when they exclude people from other races from hearing and learning about issues","Seeing as I helped found the Female Case Competition, my answer here is predictable: I fully support these endeavors. In the beginning of my college career, I did not support these competitions. I thought it was counter productive to what society tries to foster, because in the real workplace, the goal is a diverse team, not a one-gender team like my competition seemingly promoted. However, my opinion changed when I actually looked at the statistics - 1 out of 4 case competition participants were women, while the rest male when our school has about a 50/50 ratio. I did some research into why women weren't participating - it had to do with investment of time vs. reward, and the ""confidence gap"" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2016/01/20/gender-confidence-gap/#2ac3ba4a4f72) that women experience. By creating a safer zone for women to experience case competitions, we've seen participation rise in normal case competitions due to this introductory experience",Same as above - but I think it's important to do the research first to ensure that the population participating is indeed under-represented or marginalized in the skill set.

"Respectful, communicates well, diverse group of people",I am a huge fan of Sheyrl Sandberg- so most of my female empowerment values come from reading her book and listening to her talks. I agree that female empowerment means fostering an environment to encourage women to lean in to the table.,I was a member of women in business in college and found that it helped to hear and engage with women at different stages in their career. I enjoyed the organization and found that it was beneficial in building the foundation of my career goals.,"I have not been a member of a race specific interest group, but have talked to members of these groups. I think they are a great resource in high school, college, and in the working world. They help bring together people with common interest and help them develop their skills.","That would be interesting- but I do think any competitions should best prepare people for the working world. In the future, it would be rare that I competed on an all women's engagement against only women. The best ideas come from groups that have a wide range of skills and expertise.",I view it the same way as gender specific academic competitions. I want to be on engagements with people from different backgrounds because they don't think the same way I do.,"I love that McCombs has started a Female Case Competition, I hope to see this grow.

"I don't really care what the gender make-up of the team is, but I LOVE when the team lead is a woman.","It means feeling like you're gettting the same opportunities in the workplace as your male counterparts. Not having to justify or ""puff your chest"" to get what you want - especially if your male colleagues need only ask. It means looking up the leadership chain and seeing people like you (ex: women, women of color), which is the clearest example of how high you can go in a company.","I don't know if it's useful for functional groups to be gender-specific. When I'm learning about data analytics I actually feel like when there are guys around I'm more naturally competitive. But for leadership and career-oriented groups, I think it helps a lot to be gender specific. Because women tend to approach things like career conversations differently and sometimes we need a kick in the rear to remind us to speak up and not wait to be recognized.",No personal experience in these sorts of groups but I think they're relevant if you are discussing something where cultural differences are relevant.,"I think the PR/audience value (look how awesome all these women are) is higher than the value for the participants.

They create, safe spaces, a community, and a support system to help overcome gender or race specific challenges.",It's condescending and I think counter-productive. When it comes to competitions why would you send the message that women can only compete with women? It's also not helping men and women learn how to collaborate or win/lose to each other. The world does not have gender-specific anything- it's the wrong approach. Interest groups are support networks- they're different.,"Same thing as gender. That's not how life works.

,"Ability to have self empowerment to make your own decisions; not feel influenced by males to decide how to live your life; to not be evaluated different in any scenario based on gender but solely on qualifications, experiences, personality, etc - traits you can control; to have all equal opportunities available as males.","While it is nice to have women specific groups in some instances because it is just a truth that we face that women tend to be minorities in many situations, so groups allow you to talk through common questions/problems and help each other through shared experices, I do sometimes find groups like that to be self-segregating. That is also very true for things like a women's only business conference or case competition, if you are always keeping the genders separate, neither will learn how to work collectively with each other, and we'll never get past the obstacles of gender inequality.","Very similar to how I feel about gender specific groups- great to lend support to each other but becomes a problem when the groups are self segregating and are o my increasing the problem of keeping races or groups separated. I feel like with gender or race or ethnic specific groups, it can sometimes vilianize the group of people not included in the group i.e. The other gender, other races etc because it is only further causing exclusivity and segregation between conflicting parties.","Athletics is the only place I find it right when it comes to skills/academics. If it's not a physical competition where genetically, skill sets will be different, then genders should all be on the same playing field.",Self segregating - it's totally fine to have them if a group so chooses but it's still an issue of exclusivity and segregating groups of people,,18 - 24,Student,"Yes, Full-Time",Female,Graduate Degree,University of Texas

"My ideal team consists of a diverse group of individuals who are all enthusiastic and actively engaged in team work. Each individual would bring a unique and informed perspective to the group and would be considered an ""expert"" in one or multiple fields. Individuals would be excited to contribute, but would not dominate the group setting and would allow for others to provide ideas as well.","Female empowerment is pretty important to me. As someone who was raised by two military parents, I was always encouraged to pursue leadership positions, be active in sports, and to participate in arenas that might typically be seen as ""male-dominated."" Many times I would notice (especially as I got older) that I was the only woman in a room or on a leadership team. When I started getting involved in Student Government at UT, I noticed this as well. I think female empowerment is important to encourage women to pursue leadership positions and opportunities that they are just as qualified for.","Personally, I struggle with these organizations. I have always felt comfortable getting involved in non-gender specific groups and always hoped that other women felt the same. While this is my personal experience, I do understand the need for these kinds of groups to provide a ""gateway"" or ""foot-in-the-door"" for women in certain fields. Currently, I work at tech start-up where over 75% of employees are males. One of the non-profits we support is called Girlstart, an organization that focuses on getting elementary and middle school girls interested in STEM education and STEM careers. It is well-documented that women are underrepresented in these fields, and I think it is important that there are organizations and spaces that encourage women to break into fields where they might not currently see as many role models or representation. Representation is important. I think it is important for these organizations to focus on empowerment, networking, and skill-building while also understanding that their goal should be long-term systemic change.",I think my answer to this question would be very similar/identical to my gender specific groups answer. The focus for these organizations should be to increase representation in these fields and to look for long-term systemic change.,"I think these opportunities make sense as what I call a gateway opportunity. If women are underrepresented in computer science / hackathon competitions (which they are), providing an opportunity such as a women-specific competition makes sense to encourage them to participate in more competitions like this in the future.","Again, the focus of these race-specific / gender-specific competitions should be to increase representation in these fields / arenas.

"Evenly balanced across gender, age, and tenure. Encourages open conversation of difficult topics such as earning credibility, being vulnerable, showing empathy, working poorly/too much.","Female empowerment is about acknowledging the inherent differences in gender perpetuated by societal, religious, and cultural conditioning and making a deliberate effort to counteract it by promoting gender equality.","I enjoy women-specific spaces and conversations and I think there is a benefit to fostering an environment where girls feel comfortable and free to discuss, learn and challenge themselves in a way they do not feel perhaps as safe or as comfortable doing when men are around. That, however, is a tragedy in and itself that should be openly addressed and attributed to years of social brainwashing and gender discrimination. I am not a fan, however, of women-only competitions (female case comp), as I find that it creates an unrealistic environment (one sex), does not engage the portion of the population that may also need candid discussion of gender equality (men - after all, gender inequality is the whole reason such a competition would exist), and perpetuates the flawed idea that women are always competing against other women.","Similar sentiments to the last point, but I think it can be more complicated. I read recently that men see race more than gender. I think these spaces provide a comfortable home for people to interact in an environment that makes complete sense to them, and it gives them a space to discuss how to combat discrimination or get along in a white man's corporate world (maybe they use other words for this), which I think is useful. It's often those bonds that land people their jobs or promotions or deals, however. It seems natural, but is a little troubling when you consider how the same is done between men.",Oooh said it above.,I don't see their value.,"Engage both genders in discussions of gender equality in a way that is engaging and not a sob fest.

In talking to my black friends, we seem to have a trickier situation organizing. Ultimately, I long for a community and a stronger voice in all of this, but it doesn't seem like we're there yet.","Unknown. Maybe I got lucky and just beat all the boys when I won science and math stuff growing up. Honestly, if I was a kid again, and gender specific stuff was around, I'd end up doing both the co-eds and this. I would strongly dislike being encouraged to stick to girls-only stuff and stay away from co-ed stuff (warned that a guy might win, or I'm not smart enough for that). It would be demeaning.","Same as above. My high school cohort was pretty diverse. I did end up being the only Mexican kid in a lot of competitions, but I ended up winning a good proportion of them anyway. Also, most of my friends were Asian, so I'd feel lame if I couldn't go and mess around with them, be on their team, etc. What I did find empowering growing up were race-specific and gender-specific mentorship and scholarship opportunities. The over-arching idea in those was that you had to write an essay or submit something that told *your story* and how you came to terms with a hardship, and what you did about it. This way, you sort of processed the reality of what the world and your life was going to have to deal with. But, you had a chance to speak to your community about how, it was still important to you and you were grateful for being in that community, and in turn, to get praise and support back.","Mentorship in anything women want to be. So much today is about STEAM or STEM jobs. It feels demeaning if you want to be awesome in the humanities (like I initially started out)...where white guys are still usually getting more credit. It also says that, we can't succeed unless we latch onto these specific vocational pathways, like there's some door open right now and you need to take advantage of it. In my workplace, we have slack channels that share a bunch of doomsday blog posts and serve as announcements for self-promotion (because people received rewards from following the strategies in the posts or promoting themselves). If I were to read and imitate every single one of those, I would never have time to do my real job. I would love it if workplaces could empower women to do their roles in a healthy proportional balance with just gender or race based things. I went through a phase were I was like that, and at the end felt lost in my own journey because I was no longer doing work that was fulfilling. I was only talking about myself and how I could be That Woman/Brown Person who tech companies were being told to find and retain. I stopped doing that and focused more on getting my colleagues and superiors to know me, my goals, and yeah, if something shitty happened to me, they'd know, or I'd tell them a story about past sexual harrassment (like, a stalker kind of level), and how I wanted to move past that.

It's great to build camaraderie with people who have similar life experience and worldviews as you, but everyone needs to make an effort to understand ""outsiders'"" perspectives as well.

That women can walk down any street in the world without being verbally accosted or attacked.","I think these interest groups can help make great strides in moving the needle to encourage more women to be represented in positions of power.

Be confident.","Working in investment banking with mostly men, I find gender specific interest groups to be a crutch.

These common goals would be standard of results and time commitment.,Female empowerment to me means that it helps counteract the social norms and standards that often limit women only based on their gender.

The argument for female empowerment doesn't mean that (well, at least not to me). Female empowerment is a core value to make women feel more confident, boost self-esteem, and remove fear from becoming a leader; this is due to a female's past. Women are just now coming on the rise; hence, this concept is fairly new. The gender specific interest groups must not stray away from this concept but rather enhance it and move on. By moving on, I mean that women should teach other women HOW to become better leaders. Focus more on the hard work, technical skills, and building women rather than just stressing ""oh you're a woman, you can do it to..you just have to fight for it."" It's not a fight rather a journey.

The question then becomes if you want to be a part of what has historically been a man's world why on earth would you want to waste time in groups that exclude men? If nothing else it severely diminishes your networking reach. 

Or maybe the purpose is to share ideas to grow their businesses, discuss vendors or possibly HR matters. If so, again why purposely exclude a whole group of people who can undoubtedly contribute and learn as well.","Again, seems contrary to success and makes people seem rather one note. If a person/ prospective hire only engages in race/gender specific career groups, will that person work well with people who aren't like them?

Plus aren't we becoming a much more mixed race culture? Lots of people who are mixed race who will mate with other mixed race people. Then what? Or why stop at race, how about brown-eyed, red-haired or left handed people in tech? In my opinion it's kind of ridiculous","What could possibly be gained by segregating people in competitions in which gender offers no competitive advantage? For example, in cooking competitions, science fairs or math competitions women and men are equal. The playing field is level. People who want to win want to best all comers.",See answer to same question for gender specific competitions.,"I would suggest that they stop trying to empower women. Women are capable of doing anything they want to do. I think that by telling women they need to be empowered implies they aren't capable or are somehow inferior. This encourages women to fall back on this an excuse to themselves and others for underachieving. 
I do think having people of all stripes speak to /mentor kids is important for all kids. It's essential to see everyone can get where they want. For example, inspiring stories from women are equally important for boys and girls. All kids need to be encouraged to dream big and to learn skills to help them get there.",45 - 54,Retired sales mgr,No,Female,Bachelor's Degree,University of Texas
,"The ability for women to be free from obstacles in their pursuit of life, Liberty, and pursuit of happiness",Women in Engineering,Get over race already. This isn't 1950's Alabama. Seriously we have bigger things to worry about.,They end up not preparing participants for the real world,"Dumbest Idea ever. You guys say you want racial equality, and yet keep bringing up race and whining about it.

"One where everyone is on the same page, everyone pulls their equal weight and group trust among members for individuals to perform well","Empowering women to thinking more highly of themselves and their capabilities, so they can go on to achieve greater potential.","It is a little redundant, but gives a community to women in various career paths.",Same answer as above,"If there is a female only science fair, there needs to also be opportunity for a male only science fair.",Same answer as above.,"More support for outside women's organizations like sororities/spirit groups. Women are empowered when they feel strong and confident, and organizations like that help build that kind of confidence.",18 - 24,Policy Analyst,"Yes, Full-Time",Female,Some College / Associates Degree,University of Texas
An ideal team consists of a group working together to accomplish a well established goal. An ideal team also has some form of leadership to focus the team's efforts.,It means opening opportunities for women to take an active role in the secular world and community life.,They are kind of dumb and also unfair considering far more of them exist for men than women. Actually very few of these types of organizations exist for men.,"These are okay in themselves. Simultaneously though, they can be racist if each group isn't held to the same standard. However, I think it a bit of a paradox to look poorly on a ""white"" group of some kind.",That would definitely be sexist.,Definitely racist.,"I think they could better recognize the role of men in the world to realize that men and women are interdependent and should not be pinned against one another for power and control. Men need women to succeed, and women need men.",18 - 24,Student,"Yes, Full-Time",Male,Some College / Associates Degree,University of Texas
"A group of about 4-6 highly creative and proactive people, who are not afraid to contribute ideas and see them out thoroughly.","I'm going to state what I would like it to mean. I think a lot of people have a lot of stupid (pardon my bluntness) definitions of it, but I personally think it should mean making sure women understand they have the opportunity to pursue whatever they believe will fulfill them in life, and giving them the opportunity to make something of themselves through it.","I'm dubious of their effectiveness. Obviously they offer community, but in terms of development of the group is intended for a field where women are under represented, seclusion gentlemen themselves from the competition of the true environment could be disadvantageous.",Same as with gender groups.,"It seems disingenuous. To exclude any population only demeans the value of success. I would never want a boys only science fair because then a girl could rationalize the argument that I hadn't fully proven superiority there, since she didn't have the opportunity to best me.",Same as gender,"Encourage them, but dont treat them like theyre inferior. Also please understand that there's going to be tendencies of opinion and selection between the genders, and that these discrepancies are totally fine and natural, not necessarily a result of some sort of oppression.",18 - 24,Student,"Yes, Full-Time",Male,Some College / Associates Degree,University of Texas
,"The right for a woman to behave just as a man does, for all judgement to be based on skill and character. For her to be able to be proud of her being a female, but of course understand that this makes her no more special than any other human being. I.e. the argument between patriotism v. nationalism","I believe they are fine as long as they are not hurtful or disrespectful to male participants in their respective industry. Ultimately, once again, as long as the group exists for the betterment of female skill and networking, not to say that these females are inherently better than their male counterparts, as neither sex consciously determines their genitalia before birth.",Effectively the same as my female answer above ^,"They shouldn't be a thing. I do not believe there is any difference between the mental power of either sex, therefore we should all be judged equally based on skill and merit.","The same as the female answer above ^. Also: although there do exist barriers to entry for many minorities, I believe that giving anyone a separate competition without the inclusion of the majority is ultimately harmful to both members of the minority and majority. Rather than changing the rules to any competition, if minorities lack the education and institutions to aid them, we should focus on helping build those resources rather than setting them up for failure in a position that they may ultimately not be suited for, thus hopefully we can assure that the most skilled individual attains their deserved position.","More women's organizations, but I believe (UT) we already do a fine job of that and that any woman who cannot find a suitable org should be easily able to found one without challenge here.",18 - 24,Student,"Yes, Full-Time",Male,Some College / Associates Degree,University of Texas
"Hard-working, efficient, cooperative","Instilling confidence in others, encouraging both men and women to work together to form a better team/organization/system/country, etc., teaching women to embrace their strengths and work on their weaknesses instead of bringing males down","I am not in support of said organizations. Those who preach gender equality want to be treated the same as men, and gender specific interest groups entirely negate that dialogue.","Organizations as such unnecessarily exclude members of that race, only furthering racial stereotypes and prejudices. If POC and minorities want to be treated the same as everyone else, they need to halt exclusive organizations such as the ones mentioned.","Not necessary -- I believe both genders are perfectly capable of competing in academic or skill specific settings. Gender specific competitions only emphasize a perceived ""gap"" or insufficiency. What does having an all girls science fair say about girls? That they are not able to compete with boys?","Similar answer to above -- this only further perpetuates gaps and prejudices. Being treated equally means not excluding your race, gender, etc",I do not believe it is my school or workplace's responsibility to empower me or my female peers/coworkers. That is the job of my parents and I am proud to say that even my father is incredible at doing so. Men are just as important of influences to young women as female role models are.,18 - 24,"student, intern","Yes, Full-Time",Female,Some College / Associates Degree,University of Texas
