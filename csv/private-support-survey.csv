ABO will sometimes also preliminarily redirect to inapplicable documentation because they sound similar. We need better indexable support documentation.",At every opportunity,More developer documentation where possible,Having an indexable documentation by product to allow AppBank to jump into runbooks for common support issues. We have a scattered one at Confluence,"Yes, for specific improvements","We need to always tackle documentation when a problem is found, but this requires everyone being on the same page as to where to add the new documentation / FAQ entry for ABO.

I have struggled when I have left my shift one day and come back the next day to a queue which hadn't changed other than new issues being added. Obviously I'm not always aware what went on when I was away, but I think having some sort of handover would all me to evaluate how to best use my day. For example if I've worked on support all day and now there's only 1/2 issues outstanding being able to discuss with the person in NY if they will have the time to look at these to allow me to do some other work for an hour, rather than feeling like I have clear the queue as much as possible each day to avoid getting overwhelemed the following day.",Yes,"I'm very happy to speak with appbank about issues before they escalate them to us, however I think it would avoid confusion if they didn’t use peoples names in the escalation message (e.g. escalating after discussing with Abigail). When I see this with other peoples names I find it a bit confusing to know if that person on L3 is looking into the issue and just hasn't taken/responded to the issue or that they simply were the person who asked L1 to escalate "

Workflow,,,,Monthly,Daily,Weekly,I'm the SME for that specific product,,Rarely,Because of L3 supprt I learned something about the whole workflow platform and thanks to this sometimes I am abe to spot issues after change in one of the systems that can impact other systems.,"Add more details to WCC like i.e. what user is used by engine to perform http calls, what DL can be used to contact with owners of the bpmn (I know that there are ways to do this, but it will be faster and easier if those information's will be in WCC), escalation rules connected to the process/task. Last time when I was on the support I spend a lot of time with issues connected to bundle deployment so we should improve this. We probably can improve ways of refreshing entitlements when it is wrongly cached as procedure to do this is quire complicated (perform few sqls on db connect to host and perform some jmx operations a lot of people do not know how to do this) - it not happens often and mostly (or maybe even only in my case) on non prod env. I think that kata should be done by everyone and additionally agyer kata they have to create process that at least have: - human task (with complex routing rule) - boundary error - message event - service task - multi instance - notification I know that it will consume a lot of time, but after doing this these people will have more information about how engine, notifications, entitlements works and probably will be able to cover more issues with process modeling on their own. Definitely there will be less issues if everyone will write cucumber tests and right now almost no one is doing this - that is why there are not many questions connected to cucumber tests topic. We probably can add some coverage feature for deploying bundle and put there some small value at the beginning that have to be met to deploy bundle (of couse we should add possibility to deply without fulfilling this condition if there is some urgent issue).","Yes, for specific improvements","Very useful information for probably everyone is that if clients contact you for the help outside of your support rota and you see that this issue is not complex and not important and someone other can do this then ask client to create keystone ticket. After my first support a lot of clients that I helped were asking me directly about issues so it was consuming a lot of time - it is always easier and faster to write to SME than trying to find it on their own in documentation or create keystone ticket so remember to say to the clients ""Please create keystone ticket"" if issue can be handled by someone else, you are not on the support and is not important (non prod issues)."

Workflow,,,,Less than once per month,Less than once per month,Less than once per month,I'm rarely contacted outside of my shift,,Rarely,Added more logging into the code to make erros more verbose,"Maybe by having AppBank go thru some of the katas we ask developers of the platform to execute could give them more context of issues as they arise.
